              <p> The Council's mission is to reduce vehicle theft, insurance fraud, and motor vehicle theft-related crimes in Illinois. </p>
              <p> In 1991, the General Assembly established the Illinois Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Council, an 11-member coalition of representatives from the insurance industry, state's attorneys, and law enforcement officers. It is private and public partnership effectively combating motor vehicle theft and related crimes in Illinois. </p>
              <p> Members of the Council appoint Grant Review Committee members. The Grant Review Committee reviews grant proposals, budgets, and other information that must be brought before the Council. </p>
              <h5 style="color: #a83a3a; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 25px">MVTPC Trust Fund</h5>
              <p> The Illinois Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act requires insurance companies to pay $1 into a special trust fund for each private passenger automobile insured for physical damage coverage. About $6.5 million are annually collected and distributed by the Council. The funds are designated to support law enforcement programs that increase investigation and prosecution of vehicle theft-related crimes. </p>
              <p> Grants funds awarded by the Council have improved motor vehicle theft laws enforcement by establishing and supporting multi-jurisdictional task forces, investigative teams, and other anti-theft efforts throughout the state. </p>
