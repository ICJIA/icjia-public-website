      <h4>OVERDOSE REVERSAL</h4>
      <p>
        One 2010 study of distribution programs in the country found that Naloxone reversed 10,171 overdoses (CDC, 2012). The Illinois Department of Alcohol and Substance Abuse (DASA) created 22 Drug Overdose Prevention Programs statewide that provide Narcan through more than 100 designated sites under the Heroin Crisis Act. Training events for its use have been held in Springfield, Chicago, Skokie, Lake County, Rockford, and Mt. Vernon, but though law enforcement agents were invited, it is unknown how many were trained. Further, the Chicago Recovery Alliance, an action organization for those interested in providing services, education, advocacy, and support for reducing drug-related harms, has one of the countryâ€™s largest Narcan programs. Between 2001 and 2006, the Alliance prescribed more than 3,500 vials of Narcan and received 319 reports of overdose reversals (Maxwell, Bigg, Stanczykiewicz, & Carlberg-Racich, 2006).
