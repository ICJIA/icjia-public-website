            						<p> During Mr. Vinck's tenure, Illinois has made fundamental changes in the way it finances and manages its technology resources. In mid-2012, the state issued $50 million in bonds targeted exclusively at IT projects. This represented the first technology-specific bond issuance in recent memory. In September 2012, Governor Pat Quinn signed Executive Order 3 (2012) that announced the establishment of an enterprise-wide Open Operating Standard to enhance the state's commitment to participating in the open data movement. The Governor's Executive Order also took the bold step of requiring agencies to consider—and adopt where feasible—cloud computing solutions when making new IT purchases. In addition, the CIO and agencies must re-evaluate the state's application portfolio to identify opportunities for savings, efficiency, and transparency through the adoption of cloud computing and deployment of open data.
