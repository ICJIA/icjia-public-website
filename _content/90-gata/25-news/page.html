summary: 'GATA confirms the commitment of ICJIA to the Federal Uniform Guidance 2 CFR 200, which went into effect in December 2014.  The Uniform Guidance already applies to all federal grants and federal pass-through funds. GATA also requires state grants to follow these federal rules for grants which are state funded. This landmark legislations will increase accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds. Once fully implemented, it will unify processes and reduce administrative burdens for state agencies and grantees.'
