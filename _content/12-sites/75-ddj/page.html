summary: 'Data Driven Justice is a national bipartisan initiative organized by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. The initiative focuses on how local jurisdictions can use data-driven strategies to safely reduce the overreliance on incarceration of superutilizers, that is, people who have mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders and cycle repeatedly through justice and healthcare systems at great cost to taxpayers. The state of Illinois and several individual counties, including Cook, Champaign, Lake, and McLean, joined Data Driven Justice Initiative in 2016.'
