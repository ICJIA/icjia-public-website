<p>The U.S. Department of  Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance administers the Sex Offender Registration  and Notification Act (SORNA) reallocation funds awarded to the eligible state administering  agencies. </p>
<p>The Office of Justice  Programs’ (OJP) Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending,  Registering, and Tracking (SMART Office) assists jurisdictions with developing  and/or enhancing programs designed to implement the SORNA portion of the Adam  Walsh Act (42 U.S.C. § 16901, et seq.).</p>
<p>The Adam Walsh Act is  designed to protect children and adults from sexual exploitation and violent  crime, prevent child abuse and child pornography, promote Internet safety, and  honor the memory of Adam Walsh and other crime victims. SORNA was enacted to  protect the public from convicted sex offenders by establishing a comprehensive  national system for the registration and notification of those offenders.</p>
<p>OJP strongly encourages  all jurisdictions that have not yet substantially implemented SORNA to continue  to work expeditiously to implement SORNA’s requirements in order to better  protect their communities from sexual violence and exploitation. States must  pass through these reallocation funds to the designated SORNA contact agencies  to carry out the commitments described in the individual state reallocation  requests as approved by OJP.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Police  (ISP) serves as Illinois’ SORNA contact agency. As the state administering  agency, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) received a  solicited award notification from OJP requesting an application for the use of  SORNA FFY16 funds to be passed through to ISP. ICJIA and ISP developed and  submitted an application to OJP for these funds. ICJIA received the SORNA FFY16  award in September 2016. As detailed in the approved application, these SORNA FFY16  funds will be granted to ISP for staff overtime to scan the remaining paper  records into the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Unit electronic  filing system.</p>
