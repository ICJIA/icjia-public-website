<p>The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is  requesting applications for federal Residential Substance Abuse Treatment  Program and Justice Assistance Grants to implement a comprehensive opioid  medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program for justice-involved persons. A  total of $694,575 is available for this funding initiative. <strong>The application  deadline is October 3, 2016. Participation in a MANDATORY webinar on September 7,  2016, is required of all applicants.</strong></p>
<p>The MAT program has three components:</p>
<ul><li>Jail-based  substance abuse treatment including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).</li>
  <li>Pre-  and post-release case management and MAT substance abuse treatment services.</li>
  <li>Probation  supervision.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three components must  work in coordination to identify opioid-addicted jail detainees at high risk of  reoffending through validated screening and assessment. Offenders identified  for program participation must be provided jail-based substance abuse treatment  and linked to transitional case management services and community-based MAT  services for opioid addiction, including the administration of long-acting  Vivitrol. Case management and community-based substance abuse treatment staff  will work in coordination with probation officers to monitor offender progress  and compliance with monthly MAT administration.<br />
