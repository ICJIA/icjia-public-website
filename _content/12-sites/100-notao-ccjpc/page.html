<!--<p align="center">Notice of Technical Assistance Opportunity:<br />
County Criminal  Justice Planning Partnership (CCJPC) </p> -->
<p>The Illinois  Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals from counties  seeking technical assistance in the form of a County Criminal Justice Planning Partnership.  ICJIA will select, at minimum, four Illinois counties for strategic planning  assistance to be provided from June 2017 through December 2018, with the possibility  of continuation based on available resources. If federal funding is received, a  technical assistance recipients also may receive funding for Criminal Justice Coordinating Council  (CJCC) implementation, including staff hiring. <br />
  </p>
<p><u>Technical Assistance</u></p>
<p>Technical assistance  will be primarily provided by ICJIA, as well as key partners ICJIA has  recruited for this initiative. These partners include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Loyola University’s Center on Criminal Justice  Research, Policy and Practice, a multi-disciplinary initiative funded by the  MacArthur Foundation that is dedicated to strengthening Illinois’ state and  local criminal justice system through collaborative interdisciplinary research  and evaluation, professional leadership development, and targeted projects; and </li>
  <li>The National Criminal Justice Reform Project, an  initiative funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation in which Illinois  will be receiving strategic planning technical assistance from the National  Governors Association and the National Criminal Justice Association.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technical  assistance will be tailored to each county’s needs, but will generally include  assistance with developing a set of measures to gauge justice system activities  and outcomes (a criminal justice “dashboard”); training; offender profile and  programming assessment; strategic planning; the identification, adoption and  implementation of evidence-based programs and practices that that help meet the  county’s needs; and evaluation and sustainability. <br />

  </p>
<p><strong><u>Program requirements</u></strong>:<br />
  </p>
<p><u>Letters of Commitment</u></p>
<p>As CJCCs require  significant collaboration among local criminal justice stakeholders, including  governmental and non-governmental officials, applicants must submit a letter of  commitment from stakeholders who will constitute the CJCC’s leadership team.</p>
<p>The letters of  commitment should also include a pledge by stakeholder organizations to: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Participate in an evaluation of the strategic  planning effort, including the plan’s implementation and outcomes.</li>
  <li>Gather and share relevant data with ICJIA that  will be needed in order to assist the County in its strategic planning effort,  including evaluation. </li>
</ol>
<p>The letter should also  identify existing challenges and barriers to data collection and analysis.  </p>
<p><u>Membership</u></p>
<p>While CJCC individual  membership may vary somewhat depending on the specific needs of  particular counties, CJCCs should include  representatives from the three branches of government (executive, judicial, and  legislative); city and county government; and allied stakeholders from various  other entities such as education or health and human services, community based  organizations, service providers, and victim representatives. </p>
<p>CJCCs should include, at  a minimum, the:  </p>
<ol>
  <li>State’s attorney. </li>
  <li>Representative of the judiciary.</li>
  <li>Public defender.</li>
  <li>Sheriff.</li>

<p><strong><u>Eligibility Information</u></strong><u>: </u> <br />
