<p>	The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s <a href="/tvpp">Targeted Violence Prevention Program (TVPP)</a> uses a public health approach towards ideologically inspired targeted violence prevention. TVPP works with interested communities in building and sustaining community-level programs that can prevent individuals from being recruited to commit ideologically inspired targeted violence, and to help re-direct or “off-ramp” individuals who have begun down the path of violence but have not yet committed a crime.</p>


<p>The mission of TVPP is to help secure safer communities throughout Illinois.  Our communities suffer from many forms of violence such as domestic violence, sexual assaults, bullying, and gang violence.  Targeted violence inspired or justified by ideologies of hate (e.g. the Ku Klux Klan, ISIS, Neo-Nazi Skinheads, or Al Qaeda) is one more form of violence that plagues us.  We deserve to live free of all forms of violence, but to do so we must work together.</p>

<p>Ideologically inspired targeted violence, which includes violent hate crimes and domestic terrorism, are not as common as other types of violent crime in our communities, but these particular types of violence have an enormous impact when they do occur. Furthermore, these acts of violence tear apart the social fabric of our diverse communities.</p>

<p>Illinois is home to a number of active hate groups.  According to FBI hate crimes data in 2014 there were 131 cases of reported hate crimes in Illinois. Of those, 101 were cases of intimidation, assault and aggravated assault.  Even more staggering is the fact that, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over half of hate crimes committed in the United States go unreported.</p>
