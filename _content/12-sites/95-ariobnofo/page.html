<p>The  Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) Oversight Board is requesting applications from  counties or groups of counties for planning grants to convene stakeholders,  analyze data, and conduct other activities to determine how best to implement a  local ARI program to divert non-violent offenders from prison into  community-based supervision and services. </p>
		<p>By  the end of the planning grant period, funded jurisdictions must complete and  submit a local ARI implementation plan using the standard plan template  (available at <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy/standard-plan.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.icjia.state.il.us/redeploy/standard-plan.cfm</strong></a>). Funded jurisdictions are under no obligation to implement the plan.</p>
		<p>Grant  activities and expenses may include, but are not limited to: </p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Employing  an outside facilitator or strategic planning consultant.</li>
		  <li>Conducting  an outside or in-house data analysis.</li>
		  <li>Providing  stakeholder training.</li>
		  <li>Conducting  site visits to observe successful diversion programs.</li>
		  <li>Community  resource mapping.</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>A maximum of $100,000 will be made  available through this planning grant opportunity. A county or a group of  counties may request up to $30,000 under this opportunity. In past years,  counties and groups of counties have been awarded planning grants ranging from  $3,500 to $30,000. </p>
		<p>Adult  Redeploy Illinois (ARI) is a state initiative to reduce the number of  non-violent offenders entering prison. ARI provides financial incentives to  local jurisdictions (counties or judicial circuits) to increase community-based  supervision and services that are proven to reduce recidivism as safe  alternatives to incarceration. ARI sites agree to reduce by 25 percent the number of people they send to the Illinois Department of Corrections from targeted populations. ARI has grown from five  county sites in 2011 to 19 sites covering 38 counties in State Fiscal Year 2017  (SFY17). ARI planning grants  and subsequent local planning activities are a key component of the steady  growth of ARI. </p>

		<p><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p>
		<p>Any Illinois county or a group of  counties may apply for an ARI planning grant. Under the Illinois Crime  Reduction Act [730 ILCS  190/20(d).], only counties or groups of  counties can access ARI funding. Additionally, in order to be eligible to  receive ARI planning grant funds, counties must be pre-qualified through the Grant  Accountability and Transparency Act Grantee Portal, <a href="http://www.grants.illinois.gov" target="_blank"><strong>www.grants.illinois.gov</strong></a>. During pre-qualification, Dun and Bradstreet verifications  are performed, including a check of Debarred and Suspended status.  The pre-qualification process also includes a  financial and administrative risk assessment using an Internal Controls  Questionnaire. All entities found to be ineligible for an award will be notified  and informed of corrective action needed for award eligibility.</p>
	  <p><strong>Reporting:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
		<p>		  Recipients of ARI funds must submit monthly  financial reports, quarterly data reports, and final financial and data  reports. Mandatory fiscal and data report templates will be distributed to each  grantee for submission soon after the grant start date. Failure to comply with  mandatory reporting requirements will cause immediate suspension of funding of  this grant, any other grant the applicant has with ARI and the Authority, and  possible termination of the grant. If applicable, an annual audit report in  accordance with the Part 200 Uniform Requirements must be submitted. Future  awards and fund drawdowns may be withheld if reports are delinquent.<strong> </strong></p>
