		<p><strong>Available  funds:</strong>
			The Authority has budgeted $800,000 in federal fiscal year 2014 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funding for the first cycle, which includes a planning grant period of up to 12 months. Continued funding for an additional 6- to 12-month period for training and/or implementation is contingent on satisfactory progress in the preceding performance period and continued funding appropriation.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>  This purpose of this multi-year program is to reduce group  related violent crime through improving the trust and working relationships  between communities and law enforcement as well as strengthening governmental  collaboration.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Jurisdictions will have varying degrees of readiness to  implement procedural justice and focused deterrence. To facilitate readiness  and promote implementation the Authority will make available funds (through  separate contracts) for each of the three steps of the process: assessment,  training and implementation. <br>
		</p>
		<p><u><strong>First cycle: Planning</strong></u>
		</p>
		<p>Selected jurisdictions will convene local multi-disciplinary  teams (MDTs) consisting of the city mayor, law enforcement, local and federal  prosecutors, community corrections (probation, parole), and community  stakeholders. Each agency’s commitment to the assessment process is essential  to its success. Each agency is responsible for assigning a staff member with  decision making power to attend the regular (at minimum monthly) meetings,  share information and data (when applicable); participate in the planning grant  activities listed below:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enhance  effective working relationships with community, criminal justice and social  service agencies.</li>
			<li>Collaborate  across criminal justice agencies. </li>
			<li>Conduct  crime analyses using the Problem-Oriented Policing SARA (Scanning, Analysis,  Response and Assessment) Model. The Problem-Oriented Policing SARA Model is a  highly regarded and utilized comprehensive tool for local law enforcement  officials to identify their needs and focus their work. More details regarding  the SARA Model and a comprehensive outline can be found at  <a href="http://www.popcenter.org/about?p=sara" target="_blank">http://www.popcenter.org/about?p=sara</a> [<em>Applicants wishing to propose using a different assessment model must justify  why the alternative model meets the applicant’s needs and how it compares to  the SARA model</em>]. See Performance Metric in Exhibit A for minimally required data elements.</li>
			<li>Conduct  assessment of community police relations.</li>
			<li>Identify  training needs.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><u>Planning period funds may be allocated to:</u>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A  full time project manager to facilitate leadership development and cross-system  collaboration, engage in the SARA assessment process for the MDT in partnership  with an identified research partner, and develop an implementation plan. </li>
			<li>A  research partner to assist the MDT in conducting crime analysis and developing  an implementation plan that includes data collection to facilitate a process  and outcome evaluation.</li>
			<li>Travel  within Illinois to attend regional networking and information sharing events.</li>
			<li>See  the Federal Fiscal Guidelines for a complete list of allowable and unallowable  costs at <a href="http://ojp.gov/financialguide/index.htm" target="_blank">http://ojp.gov/financialguide/index.htm</a>. </li>
		</ul>

		</p>
		<p><strong>Reporting:</strong> Federal reporting requirements state that funding agencies  must report all mandatory information to the federal agency no later than 10  days after the end of the designated quarter. To do so, the Authority will  require all programs funded under this RFP to report at a minimum on a  quarterly basis and no later than 15 days after the end of the reporting  period. Mandatory fiscal and data reports will be created and distributed to  each grantee for submission. Failure to comply with mandatory reporting  requirements will cause immediate suspension of funding of this grant, any  other grants that the applicant has with the Authority, and possible  termination of the grant.<br>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Instructions to submit application:</strong>  Applications must be submitted through the online application process.
		</p>
		<p>Applications will not be accepted  in person or by mail. The applicant is responsible for notifying the Authority  of submission difficulties.<br>
		</p>
		<p>All documents and information submitted in the application  are subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. If confidential  documents or information is being submitted, the applicant must indicate that  it is confidential and the reason why the information is confidential.<br>
