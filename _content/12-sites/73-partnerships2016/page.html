	  </h3>
      <br>
		<p>The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is requesting proposals from eligible applicants to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and communities by completing the Problem-Oriented Policing Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA) process, building local research and  evaluation capacity, and implementing procedural justice and focused deterrence.
</p>
		<p>Available for this opportunity is $150,000 in FFY14 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funding. This funding will support a program planning grant period of up to 12 months.</p>
		<p><strong>Notice:</strong> </p>
		<p>Read <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/assets/partnerships/2016 Partnership NOFO Final.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Notice of Funding Opportunity Application and General  Instructions >></strong></a> <br>
                  </p>
	  <p><strong>Eligibility: </strong></p>
		<p>An entity may apply for a grant but will not be eligible for  a grant award until the entity has pre-qualified through the Grant  Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal at <a href="http://www.grants.illinois.gov" target="_blank"><strong>www.grants.illinois.gov</strong></a>. During pre-qualification, Dun and Bradstreet verifications  are performed, including a check of Debarred and Suspended status and good  standing with the Illinois Secretary of State. </p>
	  <p>The pre-qualification process  also includes a financial and administrative risk assessment with an Internal  Controls Questionnaire. All entities found to be ineligible for an award will  be notified and informed of corrective action needed for award  eligibility.    <strong></strong><br>
	    </p>
		<p>Municipalities within the following  counties are eligible to apply: </p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>Kane</li>
		  <li>Kankakee</li>
		  <li>Lake</li>
		  <li>Macon</li>
		  <li>St. Clair</li>
		  <li>Vermillion</li>
		  <li>Will</li>
	  </ul>
		<p>These counties were selected through an analysis of  violent crime in Illinois that identified counties with a mid-sized urban  center and high crime rates. In addition, no applications were received from  these jurisdictions during the last solicitation for this project.<br>
	  </p>
		<p>Each eligible county should develop a partnership that consists of the city mayor, major police department(s), state’s attorney’s office, county sheriff’s office, county probation and parole, community and faith based organizations, and U.S. Attorney’s Offices. Applicants also are encouraged to include the public defender’s office and all other players of the criminal justice system. This group must select one governmental entity as the applicant agency, responsible for submitting grant reports and other required documentation. </p>
	  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
		<p>This purpose of this multi-year program is to reduce group-related violent crime through improved trust and working relationships between communities and law enforcement as well as  strengthened governmental collaboration.<br>
	  </p>
		<p>Jurisdictions will have varying  degrees of readiness to implement procedural justice and focused deterrence. To  facilitate readiness and promote implementation the Authority will make  available funds (through separate contracts) for each of the three steps of the  process: assessment/planning, training and implementation. <br>
                </p>
	  <p><strong><u>Assessment/Planning:</u></strong> </p>
		<p>Selected jurisdictions will convene local  multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) consisting of the city mayor, law enforcement,  local and federal prosecutors, community corrections (probation, parole), and  community stakeholders. Team inclusion of the public defender’s office and all other players of the criminal justice system is encouraged. Each agency’s commitment to the assessment process is  essential to its success. Each agency is responsible for assigning a staff  member with decision-making power to attend the regular meetings (monthly, at minimum), share information and data when applicable), and participate in these planning  grant activities:<br>
	          </p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>Enhance       effective working relationships with community, criminal justice, and       social service agencies.</li>
		  <li>Collaborate       across criminal justice agencies. </li>
		  <li>Conduct       crime analyses using the Problem-Oriented Policing SARA Model. The Problem-Oriented Policing SARA Model       is a highly regarded and utilized comprehensive tool for local law       enforcement officials to identify their needs and focus their work. More       details regarding the SARA Model and a comprehensive outline can be found       at <a href="http://www.popcenter.org/about?p=sara" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.popcenter.org/about?p=sara</strong></a>. See Performance Metric in <em>Exhibit A</em> for minimally required       data elements.</li>
		  <li>Conduct       assessment of community and police relations.</li>
		  <li>Identify       training needs.</li>
	  </ul>
		<p><strong>Planning period funds may be allocated to:</strong></p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>A       full-time project manager to facilitate leadership development and       cross-system collaboration, engage in the SARA assessment process for the       MDT in partnership with an identified research partner, and develop an       implementation plan. </li>
		  <li>A       research partner to assist the MDT in conducting crime analysis and       developing an implementation plan that includes data collection to       facilitate a process and outcome evaluation.</li>
		  <li>Travel       within Illinois to attend up to four regional networking and information       sharing events.</li>
		  <li>See       the U.S. Office of Justice Program Financial Guide for a complete list of       allowable and unallowable costs at <a href="http://ojp.gov/financialguide/index.htm" target="_blank"><strong>http://ojp.gov/financialguide/index.htm</strong></a>. </li>
	  </ul>

            </p>
		<p><strong>Reporting:</strong> </p>
		<p>		  Recipients must submit  quarterly financial and progress reports and final financial and progress  reports. Federal reporting requirements  state that funding agencies must report all mandatory information to the  federal agency no later than 10 days after the end of the designated quarter. To do so, the Authority will require all programs funded to  report electronically at minimum <u>on a quarterly basis</u> and no later than  15 days after the end of each reporting period. Mandatory fiscal and progress  reports will be distributed to each grantee for submission. Failure to comply  with mandatory reporting requirements will cause immediate suspension of  funding of this grant, any other grant that applicant has with the Authority,  and possible termination of the grant. If applicable, an annual audit report in  accordance with the Part 200 Uniform Requirements must be submitted. Future  awards and fund drawdowns may be withheld if reports are delinquent.<br>
