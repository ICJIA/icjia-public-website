summary: 'As part of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Illinois, the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act established the R3 program to “directly address the impact of economic disinvestment, violence, and the historical overuse of the criminal justice responses to community and individual needs by providing resources to support local design and control of community-based responses to these impacts; to substantially reduce both the total amount of gun violence and concentrated poverty in this State; to protect communities from gun violence through targeted investments and intervention programs,…[and] to promote employment infrastructure and capacity building related to the social determinants of health in the eligible community areas.” (Illinois HB1438, Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, 2019-2020).'

<p>As part of the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Illinois, the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act established the R3 program to “directly address the impact of economic disinvestment, violence, and the historical overuse of the criminal justice responses to community and individual needs by providing resources to support local design and control of community-based responses to these impacts; to substantially reduce both the total amount of gun violence and concentrated poverty in this State; to protect communities from gun violence through targeted investments and intervention programs,…[and] to promote employment infrastructure and capacity building related to the social determinants of health in the eligible community areas.” (Illinois HB1438, Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, 2019-2020). </p><p>The ‘eligible community areas’ of the R3 Program were established by the R3 Board based on a number of factors, including rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and commitments to and returns from the Illinois Department of Corrections. Only areas identified as R3 zones based on these indicators were eligible for R3 funding.  Additionally, five areas of service delivery were identified within the R3 legislation: Civil Legal Aid, Economic Development, Reentry, Violence Prevention, and Youth Development. Funds for this program are derived from tax revenues from the legal sale of adult-use cannabis.</p>
