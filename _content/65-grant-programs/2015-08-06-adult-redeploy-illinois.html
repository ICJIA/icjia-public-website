<p>In response to declining state resources and expanding
criminal justice research about best practices in corrections, Illinois passed
the Crime Reduction Act of 2009. The Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) program was
created by the Act to increase alternatives to incarceration for non-violent
offenders. Research shows that non-violent offenders are more effectively rehabilitated
in community settings, which are also less expensive than prison. ARI provides
grants to local jurisdictions to expand their capacity to safely supervise
non-violent offenders in the community by investing in evidence-based practices
shown to reduce recidivism. In exchange for grant funding, sites agree to
reduce by 25 percent the number of non-violent offenders they send to the
Illinois Department of Corrections from their target populations.
