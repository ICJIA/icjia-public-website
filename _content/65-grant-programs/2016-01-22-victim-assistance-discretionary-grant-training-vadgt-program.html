<p>Under this award, the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) made  $25 million available to eligible state victim assistance programs to apply for  noncompetitive funding to support training and technical assistance for victim  assistance service providers and others who work with crime victims. Illinois  was awarded $946,913 for federal fiscal year 2015.  <br>
  </p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to provide each state and  territory with funding to support training and technical assistance for victim  assistance grantees and others who work with crime victims. States are  encouraged the use of the funds to enhance existing State Victim Assistance  Academies (SVAAs) or to establish new ones. These funds can also support  statewide training initiatives, crime victim related conferences, basic  training for new programs for underserved victims, and scholarships to service  providers and others who work with crime victims. As with all VOCA awards,  states would have the year of the award plus three years to spend these funds.<br>
  </p>
<p>Illinois has an extensive network of coalitions and  statewide issue groups that are supported by strong legislation dedicated to  victim rights and services.  Yet,  Illinois is a large, diverse state that still has many unmet needs in the  victim services field.  Local agencies  throughout the state struggle to meet the training and staffing needs for their  services.  Issue specific training is  available in some areas and increasingly required for some positions, but the  availability of training that is affordable and the opportunity to hear state  and national experts in many fields is often beyond the reach of local  agencies.   <br>
  </p>
<p>Funding from this program will be used to expand training  opportunities for victim service advocates throughout the state of Illinois.</p>
