summary: The mission of Ceasefire Illinois, a unit at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, is to work with community and government partners to reduce violence in all forms and help design interventions required to better define what should be included in a community or city anti-violence plan. Growing up in communities where violence is an everyday occurrence, youth learn that violence is normal and are thus more likely to use violence or become victims of violence. Ceasefire staff members work to engage this population. Staff members will help change their behavior and connect them to resources that would otherwise be out of reach.
