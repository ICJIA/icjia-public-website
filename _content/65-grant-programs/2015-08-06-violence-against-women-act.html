<p>Congress first passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 1994 and reauthorized the Act in 2000. With a reauthorization in 2005, Congress began a new initiative of the S.T.O.P. (Services * Training * Officers * Prosecutors) VAWA program by authorizing grants to states for programs that would improve the response of the criminal justice system to female victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. The program’s objectives include:</p>  <ul><li>Providing services to women who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.</li><li>Developing, implementing, and evaluating a plan for training police, prosecutors, judges, circuit clerks, probation officers, and service providers to promote an interdisciplinary approach to sexual assault and domestic violence. </li><li>Implementing measures that document and assess the response of criminal justice agencies in Illinois to sexual assault and domestic violence. </li></ul>      <p>The Act specifies that states must allocate 25 percent of the funds to law enforcement, 25 percent to prosecution, 30 percent to service providers, and 5 percent to the courts. The remaining 15 percent can be allocated at the state’s discretion. </p>
