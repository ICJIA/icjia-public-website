summary: |
  <p>The Safer Foundation (SF) partnership with Mount Sinai Hospital’s Sinai Urban Health Institute (SUHI) seeks to better understand the issues connected to gun violence in Chicago’s west side communities. As a referral partner, SUHI seeks to work with SF to build their previous study of non-fatal gun violence victims who are treated and discharged quickly. The goal is to refer such persons for SF services and to identify their social needs, gaps, resources and barriers to employment and workforce development comparing those with and those without arrest/conviction records.
  </p>
  <p>ICJIA funds will allow Safer Foundation to use mechanisms to provide additional supports to participants participating in a higher level of credentialed training and job training, including higher literacy, skill level, case management, and wrap around services.
