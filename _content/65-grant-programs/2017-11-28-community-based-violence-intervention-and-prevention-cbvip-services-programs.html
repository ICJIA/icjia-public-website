<p>Community-Based Violence Intervention and  Prevention (CBVIP) services programs support the following activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Convene  or expand an existing community coalition to engage service providers,  governmental agencies (local and/or statewide agencies), law enforcement,  faith-based, and general community members to ensure that service providers and  all potential participants are aware of violence prevention resources available  in community; develop collaborative partnerships to ensure that clients’  immediate needs are met; and provide pro-social activities for the community.</li>
  <li>Educate  the public about program services through wide distribution and various types  of program materials, public presentations and awareness events.</li>
  <li>Provide  at least one of the four following direct services:
    <ul>
      <li>Street  Intervention/Interruption-Active Outreach and Engagement – These programs  provide crisis intervention and de-escalation of high stress situations to  at-risk youth and young adults.</li>
      <li>Counseling  and Therapy – These developmentally and culturally appropriate therapeutic  services are provided by a mental health professional. </li>
      <li>Case  Management – Case management approaches that are more effective at long-term  client retention and developing trust between agency and youth/families require  actively engaging participants (i.e., active reaching out, meeting  youth/families in the home, community engagement).</li>
      <li>Youth  Development – Engaging young people to develop their emotional, physical,  social, and intellectual selves provides opportunities for youth to practice  conflict resolution and prosocial life skills.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
