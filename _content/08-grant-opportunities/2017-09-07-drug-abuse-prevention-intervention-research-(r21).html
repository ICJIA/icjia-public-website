This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages R21 grant applications for research that will employ rigorous scientific methods to test theoretically derived hypotheses to increase understanding of the science of drug use prevention within diverse populations and settings and across the lifespan. The FOA seeks applications that encompass investigations of cognitive, behavioral, and social processes as they relate to: 1) development of novel prevention approaches; 2) efficacy and effectiveness of prevention interventions or programs; 3) processes that optimize the selection, integration, implementation and sustainability of science-based prevention, including systems-level and health economic factors; and 4) methodologies appropriate for studying complex aspects of prevention science.
