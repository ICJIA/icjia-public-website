<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>An estimated 63 percent of sentenced jail inmates meet criteria for having substance use disorders (SUD) compared to 9 percent in the general population.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> These individuals are more likely
    to have additional contacts with the criminal justice system and re-offend upon release compared to those without SUD.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> In 2013, the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program collected
    drug use data from arrestees booked into detention or jail in Cook and five other counties across the country. The program found 83 percent of adult male arrestees in the Chicago sample tested positive for illicit drugs, more than the 60 percent collectively
testing positive in 10 other jurisdictions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority researchers examined how county jails in Illinois are responding to detainees with opioid use disorders. Researchers surveyed jail administrators to better understand their use of medications, naloxone distribution,
and policy for safe opioid withdrawal within their populations.</p>

<h2 id="review-of-the-literature">Review of the Literature</h2>
<p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing, diagnosable condition. Those with OUD continue to use opioids despite negative consequences and feel compelled to continue use. Opioids are a group of drugs that when used incorrectly can suppress breathing,
    making individuals more susceptible to overdose death. In 2017, opioid-related overdoses claimed the lives of <a href="https://idph.illinois.gov/OpioidDataDashboard/">2,110 Illinois residents</a>, more than one and a half times the number of homicide
    deaths and double the number of car accident-related deaths.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Of the 20,927 individuals in custody within the Illinois Department of Corrections on June 6, 2018, whose completed TCU-II
    drug screens were available, 2,562 (12.2 percent) self-reported opioid use as their most serious drug problem.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> A survey of state and federal prisoners showed while half met criteria
    for substance use disorders, fewer than 20 percent received treatment. Only 15 percent of state and 17 percent of federal prisoners reported having received drug treatment. After a stay in corrections, the risk of overdose is enhanced due to reduced
    tolerance after a period of abstinence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Research in Washington State found a relative risk of death from overdose within the first two weeks after release from prison was 12.7 times
    greater than similar individuals in the general population.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="safe-withdrawal-in-jails">Safe Withdrawal in Jails</h3>
<p>Acute withdrawal symptoms due to substance dependence are common in jails that require detoxification from illicit drugs upon admission.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> Opioid withdrawal symptoms start within four to
    six hours of last use of substance and increase in severity the longer the user is without drugs or proper treatment. Symptoms diminish within five to seven days.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> Symptoms begin
    with yawning, tearing in the eyes, and runny nose and advance to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, body pains, and hypertension.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Symptoms vary based on the quantity of use and how the
    drugs were administered into the body.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> While death from withdrawal is uncommon, the complications of withdrawal can cause death. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>    This includes vomiting, which can cause asphyxiation, severe dehydration from sweating and diarrhea, and suicidal thoughts during severe withdrawal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Forced abstinence of pregnant women dependent on opioids causes withdrawal of the mother and the fetus. Withdrawal may lead to neonatal abstinence syndrome, stunted growth, preterm labor, fetal convulsions, and possible death for the fetus.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>    People with OUDs, including pregnant women, can prevent withdrawal—along with unwanted symptoms and dangerous complications—if jails offer and administer the agonist/partial agonist medications methadone or buprenorphine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>The United States Supreme Court ruled that withdrawal symptoms are a medical condition. Under the Eighth Amendment, correctional facilities, including jails, are required to provide proper medical care to detainees.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>    Illinois jails are not required to have protocols to treat withdrawal symptoms, but the <a href="ftp://www.ilga.gov/jcar/admincode/020/020007010000900R.html">Illinois Administrative Code, Section 701.9 on medical and mental health care</a> requires
    jails to offer medical services that treat substance dependence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="medication-assisted-treatment-in-corrections">Medication-Assisted Treatment in Corrections</h3>
<p>As is the case with many chronic health conditions, individuals with OUDs have a higher chance of success—retention in treatment and avoidance of continued illicit opioid use—when they receive medication and behavioral therapy, or medication-assisted
    treatment (MAT).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> The three FDA-approved prescription drug options for opioid use disorders are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone (<em>Table 1</em>). Those taking daily prescribed
    methadone or buprenorphine often are forced to discontinue use upon jail detention, resulting in withdrawal, discomfort, and heightened vulnerability to relapse and overdose upon release due to reduced tolerance. It is recommended that medications
    be offered early, at the beginning stages of physical withdrawal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> According to the World Health Organization, those in correctional facilities should be afforded the same care that
    is available outside of correctional facilities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, all correctional detainees and inmates, regardless of sentencing status, should continue using medications they have been prescribed for the treatment of OUD.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup>    Inmates inducted on naltrexone must have been withdrawn and abstinent from opioids for seven to 10 days, but the other two medications do not require withdrawal.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some states have reduced opioid overdose death among people released from incarceration through jail-based MAT programs. These include California, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, West Virginia;
    however, most offer only naltrexone (brand name Vivitrol®). Rhode Island offers all three medications and has since reported a 60 percent reduction in post-release opioid overdose deaths.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to medication, behavioral therapies can be offered to jail detainees. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (DHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), barriers to effective jail-based
    behavioral treatment programs include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lack of funding for programs.</li>
    <li>Limited time individuals spend in the jail.</li>
    <li>Facility space limitations.</li>
    <li>Refusal of treatment providers to work in jails.</li>
    <li>Overlapping concerns between substance abuse and criminal justice system. Substance abuse treatment focuses on rehabilitation and safety, while the justice system focuses on punishment.</li>
    <li>Information-sharing complications between treatment providers and criminal justice staff.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="naloxone-distribution-in-corrections">Naloxone Distribution in Corrections</h3>
<p>In a meta-analysis examining six studies, it was found that those with opioid use disorders are three to eight times more likely to overdose within two weeks of their release.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup> An increase in the number
    of overdoses has been attributed to increased street access to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> Overdose from opioids are usually accidental,
    and most occur in the presence of other individuals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Naloxone (brand name Narcan®) is an opioid antagonist that reverses effects of an opioid overdose and can be administered by minimally trained individuals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup> Despite its benefit, there
    continues to be a need for training on and use of naloxone for those being released from jail and prison. Training on proper use is important because by the time an individual experiences respiratory depression, it may be too far into the overdose
    to successfully reverse it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> Jails across the country have begun to distribute naloxone. Rikers Island Jail, for instance, has distributed naloxone to friends and families of inmates
    during jail visits since 2014.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> Friend and family connections are important because a person cannot administer naloxone on themselves when experiencing an overdose.</p>
<p>A 2009 study found that 90 percent of a sample of criminal justice-involved opioid users were willing to participate in training on naloxone administration and overdose prevention, and research indicates that education and training can improve attitudes
    and knowledge about the value of naloxone.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup> The Vera Institute of Justice, for instance, found that an overdose education and naloxone distribution program instituted in the New York
    correctional system increased respondents’ knowledge on how to help someone who is overdosing from an opioid.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup> In a review of 19 studies of take home naloxone in corrections settings,
    research suggests training of inmates translates to use of naloxone after release.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup> Less is known about its direct impact on opioid-related death rates. Research on naloxone programs
    post-jail or prison release has focused on knowledge of and beliefs about the program rather than determining how they impact mortality rates.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="current-study">Current Study</h2>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>ICJIA researchers asked the Illinois Sheriff’s Association to send an online survey via email to its members—sheriffs and jail administrators—in April and May 2018. Researchers completed survey reminders by phone and email in June 2018. The survey was
    closed and the data downloaded for analysis on July 22, 2018.</p>
<p>The research study was approved by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s Institutional Review Board. All respondents were required to review a consent form and agree to participate in the study. The survey consisted of 57 questions, including
    six on withdrawal/detoxification, 47 on MAT, and four on naloxone. The survey was created using Qualtrics, online survey software. Many questions were derived from a similar national study of criminal justice practitioners, the Criminal Justice-Drug
    Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup> The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS statistical software.</p>
<p>A total of 40 responses were received, but four surveys were removed. Therefore, the final sample size was 36 of 92 Illinois jails or 39 percent. Researchers sought to gain input from one representative per county, so in the cases of multiple county surveys,
    the sheriff’s responses were kept in the sample and responses from other staff titles, such as lieutenant, were removed from the sample. <em>Table 2</em> offers more detail on the final sample. Many of the responding counties were from jurisdictions
    with relatively high opioid overdose death rates. Counties represented in the sample accounted for 71 percent of <a href="https://idph.illinois.gov/OpioidDataDashboard/">overdose deaths in 2017 according to the Illinois Department of Public Health</a>.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>One limitation of low response rates is that they can impact generalizability of the findings making results of this survey not representative of all jails in the state. While a 39 percent response rate is somewhat low, similar online surveys have yielded
    an average response rate of 10 to 15 percent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup> Therefore, the response rate for this survey was not uncommon for the method and target respondents.</p>

<h3 id="main-findings">Main Findings</h3>
<p>Eighty-nine percent of responding jails reported a <em>moderate</em> to <em>serious</em> problem with opioid misuse in their jurisdiction (n=32) and 11 percent reported it was a <em>slight</em> problem (n=4). The following are findings from the survey
    of jails regarding withdrawal/medical detox, MAT, and naloxone.</p>

<h4 id="opioid-withdrawal-and-detox">Opioid Withdrawal and Detox</h4>
<p>Seventy-eight percent of the jails reported having protocols for treating withdrawal symptoms (n=28) (<em>Figure 1</em>). Five jail administrators reported having no protocol for detainees experiencing withdrawal symptoms, and three responded “don’t know.”
    Respondents were asked to indicate any treatment provisions to individuals going through withdrawal from opioids or other substances. Jail administrators reported providing medications such as hydroxyzine (n=2), loperamide (n=2), over-the-counter
    medications such as acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen (n=2), and Gatorade (n=2) to treat symptoms.</p>
<p>Medical opioid detoxification consists of the provision of medical care to manage physical symptoms of withdrawal, and may involve administration of medication. Nearly 40 percent of jail administrators who responded to the survey reported offering medicines
    for opioid withdrawal (n=14). Specifically, they reported offering methadone (n=4), benzodiazepines (n=3), buprenorphine (n=3), and clonidine (n=2).</p>

<p>Twenty-two percent of the responding jail administrators indicated they offer MAT to detainees (n=8) (<em>Figure 2</em>). Three jails specifically mentioned offering methadone to pregnant women, which is the standard of care for that population.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>    Methadone, as well as buprenorphine, have been shown to be safe and effective for women with OUD to reduce neonatal abstinence syndrome and other complications.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>Of the three medications, naltrexone was the most commonly prescribed (n=5). Three jails reported having on-staff nurses, and two reported that outside treatment providers administer naloxone injections in the jail. All five jails connected individuals
    to a naltrexone provider prior to release.</p>
<p>All five jails offering naltrexone stated the medication was paid for with grant funding. The four jails offering methadone indicated the medication was paid for by the jail, (n=2), private insurance (n=1), or out of the pharmacy budget (n=1). Of the
    three jails offering buprenorphine, one reported the medication was paid by grant funds and by the jail.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked about protocols for pretrial detainees who enter jail while being prescribed the medications buprenorphine or methadone and go on to be sentenced to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). One respondent commented that individuals
    entering jail with a prescription to those medications have an addiction to them. Another noted that they do receive those medications while in jail custody because they are cost prohibitive. Finally, one respondent said that jail detainees are tapered
    off of those medications because if subsequently sentenced to prison, IDOC will not continue their use.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3</em> depicts the barriers to offering MAT in jails. Twenty-two percent of responding jail administrators said that overall, barriers to MAT existed to a <em>moderate</em> or <em>great extent</em>. Forty-two percent of respondents indicated
    that cost was the greatest barrier to offering MAT in their facilities. Others expressed concerns about legal liability due to the jail potentially contributing to diversion of the medication in the jail and potential overdose. Another barrier was
    the general lack of training on how to administer MAT medications and programs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> A jail administrator also cited a lack of community providers, facility space, and on-site nursing
    or medical staff to provide care.</p>

<p>Eight respondents reported that it was <em>likely</em> or <em>very likely</em> that they would <em>introduce</em> MAT within their jails, and six reported that they would <em>expand</em> MAT in the next two years (<em>Table 3</em>). Jail administrators
    were asked to indicate if they would consider expanding or were open to offering specific MAT medications. Respondents were most open to and more apt to consider expanding naltrexone than the other two medications in their facilities.</p>

<h4 id="findings-on-naloxone-distribution">Findings on Naloxone Distribution</h4>
<p>Based on survey responses, 50 percent of the responding jails gave their correctional officers access to naloxone in the facility (n=18), and in six jails, correctional officers were required to carry naloxone (<em>Figure 4</em>). Twenty percent of responding
    jails reported they either offered naloxone to detainees at the time of their release or were planning to in the future. While no responding Illinois jails provided naloxone to family or friends of detainees, one facility reported that it plans to
    do so in the future.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Survey findings offer insight into how jail administrators can take steps to improve the short- and long-term care of those detained with opioid use disorders. It is well-known that jails—broadly speaking and also more specifically those offering medical
    services and substance use disorder treatment—have limited resources and face security challenges. However, jails can assist detainees with opioid use dependence and disorders by managing withdrawal, offering medication-assisted and behavioral health
    treatment, and teaching and encouraging methods of overdose prevention. Researchers suggest following recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="ensure-safe-withdrawal-from-opioids-with-training-and-best-practices">Ensure Safe Withdrawal from Opioids with Training and Best Practices</h3>
<p>Of the 36 Illinois jails responding to the survey, five reported having no protocol for detainees experiencing withdrawal symptoms and seven reported offering no medical detoxification. However, the survey did not assess quality or sufficiency of the
    protocols in place. Four jail administrators reported offering methadone and three reported offering buprenorphine. The World Health Organization and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) offer guidelines to best care for individuals
    suffering from withdrawal symptoms while incarcerated. In 2009, WHO developed clinical guidelines stating that detainees with mild opioid withdrawal should drink 2-3 liters of water per day and take vitamin B and vitamin C supplements, while inmates
    with moderate to severe withdrawals should be offered buprenorphine, methadone, or codeine phosphate and closely monitored.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup></p>
<p>NCCHC recommends properly training staff to handle withdrawal symptoms. Correctional facilities should help staff recognize opioid withdrawal symptoms and understand the consequences when they are left untreated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup>    It is also recommended that inmates at high risk for acute withdrawal are referred to a facility better suited to manage their needs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> Inmates dealing with acute withdrawal should
    be monitored every half-hour to ensure normal respiration levels.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="offer-all-three-fda-approved-medications-and-evidence-based-treatment-for-detainees-with-opioid-use-disorders">Offer All Three FDA-approved Medications and Evidence-Based Treatment for Detainees with Opioid Use Disorders</h3>
<p>Opioid use disorder treatment is an individualized process that may include FDA-approved medications prescribed by a physician. The United States is one of the only countries in which opioid agonist/partial agonist medications (buprenorphine and methadone)
    are not consistently offered in correctional settings despite evidence of their effectiveness and classification by the World Health Organization as essential medications. Only a small portion of Illinois jails responding to the survey (22 percent)
    indicated that they offer MAT to detainees, and most commonly they offered only naltrexone-based MAT. New research has found buprenorphine and methadone to be associated with reduction of opioid-related death as well as death from any cause, but naltrexone
    was not.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> In addition, research indicates that providing only injectable naltrexone in a correctional setting is not cost effective due to the high cost of the medication.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>Jails starting an opioid treatment program (OTP) using methadone must obtain certification from SAMHSA, per federal law. To become certified, the OTP first must be accredited by a federally approved body, such as NCCHC. NCCHC offers <a href="https://www.ncchc.org/opioid-treatment-programs-2">Standards for Opioid Treatment Programs in Correctional Facilities</a>    based on federal regulations focused on care and limitations in jails.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup> Qualified physicians must apply for <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/buprenorphine-waiver-management/qualify-for-physician-waiver">waivers to prescribe or dispense buprenorphine</a>    in correctional facilities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition to or in absence of medications, jails should offer behavioral therapy. ICJIA researchers developed a <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/reducing-substance-use-disorders-and-related-offending-a-continuum-of-evidence-informed-practices-in-the-criminal-justice-system">web-based continuum on evidence-informed practices for addressing SUDs and substance misuse</a>    to guide criminal justice system assessment, planning, and implementation efforts around SUD prevention and intervention. The continuum offers information on current evidence-based practices for jails and includes behavioral therapies, such as cognitive
    behavioral therapy (CBT) and therapeutic communities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup> As correctional systems implement MAT programs, sufficient access to treatment upon return to the community is imperative. Continued
    treatment at the community level will help reduce recidivism, reduce relapse and overdose, and increase individuals’ quality of life.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="train-on-and-distribute-naloxone-to-jail-detainees-with-opioid-use-disorders-and-their-friends-and-families">Train on and Distribute Naloxone to Jail Detainees with Opioid Use Disorders and Their Friends and Families</h3>
<p>A majority of responding jails did not offer naloxone to detainees or their family members or friends at the time of their release. The low rate of distribution to friends and family is especially problematic considering that naloxone cannot be self-administered.
    Increasing the availability of naloxone to those who may be around someone who is overdosing on an opioid increases the chances of its life-saving benefits. Thus, jails in Illinois should work to increase naloxone distribution and training to detainees
    and their close friends or families.</p>
<p>Based on recommendations from the Vera Institute of Justice, facilities that decide to implement naloxone distribution programs should engage staff and create partnerships with community organizations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup>    Additionally, facilities should create programs that encourage as much inmate and family/friend participation as possible to decrease future risk of overdose death.</p>
<p>Incarcerated individuals may be less likely to accept naloxone kits at the time of their release due to fear of future legal system involvement. The Vera Institute of Justice found that individuals in New York would not accept kits out of fear of mistreatment
    by the justice system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup> Further, uncertainty about protections under the Good Samaritan Law, which provides limited immunity from prosecution when seeking medical assistance for an
    overdose, reportedly made releasees fearful of taking the kits, as they were unsure if they would be protected after administering naloxone.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup> In Illinois jails, those who train inmates
    on and distribute naloxone should include information on the state’s Good Samaritan Law.</p>
<p>In Illinois, the Lake County Health Department has a program in which they train on and distribute naloxone to inmates in their local jail.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup> The program has increased knowledge on overdoses
    and empowered those within the community.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup> Other Illinois counties can look to the Lake County Health Department as a reference for beginning their own training program.</p>
