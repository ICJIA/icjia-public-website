<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Most states, including Illinois, operate criminal justice systems at the county level and with little coordination between them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Illinois’ 102 counties and 24 judicial circuits have unique
    issues and needs with varying resources and support. Each department of the criminal justice system, from police to parole, is individually funded with impact and success defined within the narrow scope of each organization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>    Criminal justice coordinating councils (CJCCs) offer a way for these agencies to collaboratively address county criminal justice issues.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>


    <div class="pullquote quote right" style="font-size: 22px;">
  THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS COMPRISED OF VARIOUS INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED IN A "SILO" FASHION-FOCUSING PREDOMINANTLY ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND ACTIVITIES. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>
    </div>


    Much of the quantitative and qualitative research
    on coordinating council efficacy and efficiency comes from studies on domestic violence and family violence coordinating councils</p>







<p>The <a href="http://www.icjia.org/cjreform2015/index.html">Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform</a> recommended the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) establish county-based CJCCs. To help jurisdictions
    implement CJCCs, ICJIA partnered with the National Criminal Justice Reform Project from the National Governors Association; Loyola University’s Center on Criminal Justice Research, Policy and Practice; and the National Criminal Justice Association
    to offer technical support, data analysis, and strategic planning assistance.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> In 2017, ICJIA awarded five counties—Lake, McHenry, McLean, Winnebago, and St. Clair counties technical
    assistance grants to establish CJCCs.</p>

<h3 id="cjcc-overview">CJCC Overview</h3>
<p>CJCCs are committees that facilitate cross-agency collaboration and information exchange within the criminal justice system.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> CJCCs assist counties in creating and sustaining collaboration
    among a variety of criminal justice agencies and stakeholders while gaining a more thorough understanding of criminal justice issues. Additionally, CJCCs can guide better use of resources, reduce costs of the criminal justice system, and devise more
    effective and sustainable criminal justice initiatives and programs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> CJCCs may operate to address general criminal justice issues or target specific criminal justice issues, including
    domestic violence, intimate partner violence, family violence, and juvenile justice.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The scope of CJCCs is broad and may vary based on legislative and internal mandates. CJCCs feature committee membership and typically focus on policy development, resource allocation, and problem-solving complex social issues through coordinated efforts.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> Councils achieve this through:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data collection and analysis of criminal justice operations.</li>
    <li>Identification of the most pervasive problems.</li>
    <li>Collaboration toward solutions.</li>
    <li>Development of budget strategies.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The country’s first CJCC formed in the 1930s in Los Angeles, Calif., to address a perceived juvenile “crime wave.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> CJCCs continued to develop in the United States in the late 1960s and
    early 1970s as state and local governments collaborated on how federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration funding would be spent. Today, while the United States is comprised of more than 3,000 counties, fewer than 100 CJCCs exist in a capacity
    outside of collaborating as a necessary condition of awarded federal or state grant funding.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="membership-staff">Membership & Staff</h3>
<p>CJCC membership varies based on county size, though most generally consist of elected and/or appointed local justice agency directors, others with a vested interest in local government, and community members. These may include substance use and mental
    health treatment providers; victim’s advocates; those offering housing resources; workforce training or educational assistance; veteran’s advocates; members of faith-based groups; offender rights group representatives; and former offenders.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>    Since many CJCCs form in response to an ad hoc need, after the urgency of a problem wanes, some members may become less engaged.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> To be effective, CJCCs need consistent engagement
    from its members. CJCCs include an executive committee and some establish subcommittees to cover special topics or issues that arise.</p>
<p>Generally, CJCCs are housed within county administration offices; a survey of 60 CJCCs in 17 states found 70 percent of CJCC staff were housed in county administration offices.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> Some
    CJCCs hire dedicated staff to aid in establishing long-term criminal justice system coordination.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> These individuals typically report to the county manager. Job duties include planning
    meetings; keeping records; grant writing or assisting agencies in applying for grants; and writing briefs and reports.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> CJCC staff should be skilled in project management, data analysis,
    grant management, and other skills based on county needs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> The <a href="http://www.jmijustice.org/network-coordination/national-network-criminal-justice-coordinating-councils/national-network-criminal-justice-coordinating-councils-nncjcc-resources/">Justice Management Institute’s National Network of Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils</a>    offers sample CJCC staff job descriptions and other CJCC resources.</p>
<h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>
<p>Counties with CJCCs are in a better position to apply for and be awarded grant funding to address criminal justice issues. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> Councils that can illustrate collaborative problem-solving
    may be more attractive to funding agencies. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> A funding source, such as county or grant funds, can help solidify agency buy-in and support coordination efforts because resources are
    available to help reach set goals. However, in a study of 66 CJCCs in 17 states, 42 percent of CJCCs reported having no budget. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> Challenges to CJCCs in accomplishing their goals
    are budgetary/fiscal issues and internal structure/operational issues.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="potential-benefits-of-cjccs">Potential Benefits of CJCCs</h2>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<p>CJCCs offer a way for criminal justice system practitioners and advocates in the community to collaborate on county issues. For example, court budgets are often developed without proper consideration of how other agencies will be affected. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>    Therefore, limited funds may not be used to the greatest advantage. More effective resource allocation, as well as more cooperative agencies and more transparency, can help improve public opinion and trust in the justice system. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="problem-solving">Problem-Solving</h3>
<p>Problem-solving justice features criminal justice systems working on understanding their local criminal justice issues to promote the most effective prevention and intervention on all types of crimes and offenders. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup>    Principles of problem-solving justice include enhanced information to improve justice decision-making, community engagement, collaboration, individualized justice, and offender accountability. Problem-solving justice addresses crime but also collectively
    attempts to prevent crime, improve public confidence in justice, and reduce recidivism. For example, the Evidence-Based Policing Matrix produced by George Mason University’s <a href="http://cebcp.org/">Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy</a> suggests
    collaborative, problem-solving justice initiatives are more likely to be successful than those that are not collaborative. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup> CJCCs promote problem-solving justice, which allows criminal
    justice system players to respond more creatively to local crime. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="system-change">System-Change</h3>
<p>Agency coordination through CJCCs can lead to system-wide impact, such as how resources are allocated and initiatives developed. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> Resource scarcity makes it necessary for organizations
    in in the social, governmental, and business sectors to work together. In addition, CJCCs meet to understand current evidence-based practices in their local criminal justice system, as well as support the implementation of additional practices.</p>
<h3 id="cost-savings">Cost-Savings</h3>
<p>CJCC stakeholders work across agencies and jurisdiction to find the drivers of criminal justice cost and investigate cost-effective alternatives. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Given the size of local justice agencies,
    CJCCs can create long-term cost saving plan that compensates for the initial high investment of members’ time for coordination and set-up. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="best-practices-of-cjccs">Best Practices of CJCCs</h2>
<p>Based on discussions with criminal justice coordinating council chairs and directors, Wickman and colleagues identified key components of effective and long-lasting CJCCs. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> These components
    include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Clearly stated mission</strong> and role to increase the CJCC’s legitimacy and enable the CJCC to address criminal justice system data collection, analysis, and planning.</li>
    <li><strong>A council structure,</strong> particularly as it relates to the CJCC’s membership, general governmental relationship, and policies and procedures for council operations and organization. This includes a holistic, systemic approach to membership
        (elected/appointed officials, community members, and other criminal justice agency representatives and leaders), with a close, yet independent, link to county or city government.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality staff</strong> that are trained, experienced, and have appropriate political, managerial, and administrative skills to support planning and policy development. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></li>
    <li><strong>Data sharing, collection, and analysis</strong> on system operations to help fully assess system-wide performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotion of evidence-based practices</strong> into ongoing system-wide operations, including quality assurance measures for implementation and sustainability. Most challenging for CJCCs is identifying evidence-based practices and current
        programs that may need revising, taking steps to make these revisions or seek alternatives, and start systematic action planning.</li>
    <li><strong>Plans for system operations in case of an emergency</strong> such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, riots, flu pandemics, and bomb threats.</li>
    <li><strong>Fair budget and resource appropriation</strong> made collectively in a neutral and credible manner to obtain system improvement goals. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The following features foster an environment that helps initiate and sustain change: <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sharing the power of decision-making within the CJCC. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Flexibility in determining the scope of CJCC work. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Providing equal distribution of rewards and benefits among members. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Incorporating highly skilled members. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup></li>
    <li>Emphasizing quality, rather than quantity, of efforts. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measuring-performance">Measuring Performance</h2>
<p>Little research exists on how CJCCs affect criminal justice outcomes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup> Research is needed to examine the impact of collaboration on the criminal justice system. What limited research
    that does exist has examined how CJCCs operate and components of effective CJCCs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> Researchers identified several studies, all focusing on coordinating councils that handle one criminal
    justice issue, either domestic violence or family violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> CJCC members and staff, potentially in collaboration with a university or government researcher, can conduct needs assessments,
    establish criterion for success, and evaluate processes, outcomes, and cost-benefits.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> CJCCs should gauge performance based on quantifiable measures, such as the number of grant applications
    submitted or awarded, as well as system intervention outcomes and criminal justice system cost savings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> Public opinion also should be considered in evaluating success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>CJCCs are encouraged to consider data systems integration to expedite information exchange on criminal justice clients and allow data collection that would guide CJCC initiatives. Also, having data collected uniformly across the system means that programs
    can be evaluated with more certainty and complexity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> However, these data systems can be expensive, especially initially. For cash strapped jurisdictions, finding the capital to replace
    older information system can be prohibitive.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the United States General Accounting Office noted,</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The criminal justice process—from arrest through correctional supervision —in any jurisdiction is generally complex and typically involves a number of participants including police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, courts, and corrections agencies.
        Because of the large number of agencies involved, coordination among agencies is necessary for the process to function as efficiently as possible within the requirements of due process. That is, all involved agencies need to work together to ensure
        proper and efficient system operations, identify any problems that emerge, and decide how best to balance competing interests in resolving these problems.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prevent and solve local crime problems and justice issues, CJCCs bring together the different players in the criminal justice system and the community. While CJCCs can offer better coordination and problem-solving approaches, commitment and investment
    is needed from its members. Activities such as agenda setting, establishing staff, and data collection may take time and money.</p>
<p>Administrators should measure program activities toward achieving their set goals, as well as level of collaboration and sustainability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup> Little is known about outcomes of CJCCs, so more
    rigorous research is needed. Research on effectiveness of CJCCs and the potential impacts on crime is needed to recognize them as an evidence-based practice.</p>
