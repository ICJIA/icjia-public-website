teaser: Synthetic drug use is a growing public health concern. Synthetics are often cheaper and more readily available than cannabis and amphetamines, making them attractive alternatives to other illicit drugs. In addition, the chemical formulas for these drugs are constantly changing, making them difficult to regulate, and their detection is limited in commonly used drug screenings. Authority researchers partnered with WestCare Foundation to survey 573 state prisoners on synthetic drug use to examine prevalence, accessibility, motivation for use, and effects. Thirty-six percent of respondents reported any synthetic drug use in their lifetime prior to incarceration. Findings suggested a proportion of the criminal justice population engages in synthetic drug use and the findings were consistent with other research on synthetic drug use.

<p>Synthetic drugs, also known as designer drugs, have become an increasing public health concern to criminal justice practitioners. Synthetics are often cheaper and more readily available than cannabis and amphetamines, making them attractive alternatives to  other illicit drugs. Also challenging is that their chemical formulas are constantly changing, making them difficult to regulate and control. The chemical makeup of synthetic drugs can be easily modified, creating regulation obstacles for law enforcement, prosecutors, and lawmakers. As chemical compounds are identified and banned by authorities, producers swiftly adapt with new elements to create other technically legal synthetic drugs.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="See footnote" class="footnote">1</a><br>
</p>
<p>An added challenge to addressing synthetic drug use, particularly among those involved in the criminal justice system, is that synthetic drugs are not always detected with commonly used drug tests. Standard tests typically screen for a limited number of substances.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="See footnote" class="footnote">2</a>  More advanced drug panel screenings can detect synthetic drugs, but they are more expensive and not always available to criminal justice practitioners. This is compounded by the constant modifications in chemical make-up.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="See footnote" class="footnote">3</a>   As a result, little is known about the actual prevalence and use of synthetic drugs among those involved in the criminal justice system. To examine the issue, Authority researchers partnered with WestCare Foundation to conduct a study on synthetic drug use among individuals enrolled in substance abuse programs within two state correctional facilities. Major findings from the study, including reported prevalence of use, reasons for use, how the drugs were obtained, and their effects are described here.

<h2 id="what-are-synthetic-drugs">What are synthetic drugs?</h2>
<p>Synthetic marijuana, also called spice, herbal incense, potpourri, and K2, typically originate in China and are sent to U.S. processing labs in homes and warehouses.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="See footnote" class="footnote">4</a>  THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, is synthetically produced and then diluted with acetone or alcohol to create a liquid solution that is sprayed on a mixture of herbal leaves, which are then dried, packaged, and sold.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="See footnote" class="footnote">5</a>
</p>
<p>Synthetic cathinones, commonly referred to as bath salts or plant food, are similar both chemically and in appearance to methamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy, mimicking their stimulant effects.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="See footnote" class="footnote">6</a>   Synthetic drugs are sold in convenience stores, gas stations, and on the Internet in packages lacking ingredient lists making the compounds difficult to identify.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="See footnote" class="footnote">7</a>  Though similar in name and sometimes appearance, these “bath salts” are not those sold in bath and body shops.
</p>
<h2 id="danger-of-synthetic-drugs">Danger of synthetic drugs</h2>
<p>The synthetic chemical compounds used to manufacture synthetic marijuana have a potency between four and 100 times that of marijuana.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="See footnote" class="footnote">8</a>  Other psychoactive compounds have been found in synthetic marijuana samples, such as synthetic opioids.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="See footnote" class="footnote">9</a>  Synthetic marijuana typically affects the body’s central nervous system and cardiovascular system, as well as gastrointestinal areas.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="See footnote" class="footnote">10</a>  Psychoactive effects of synthetic marijuana include cognitive impairment, behavioral disruptions, such as violent behavior and suicidal thoughts, drastic mood changes, paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="See footnote" class="footnote">11</a>  Physical effects may include seizures, psychosis, increased heart rate, cardiotoxicity (weakening of the heart muscles), drowsiness, and vomiting.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="See footnote" class="footnote">12</a>  Synthetic marijuana or bath salt use to intoxication can be associated with injury or death.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="See footnote" class="footnote">13</a>
</p>
<p>Bath salt use may result in a variety of symptoms similar to those of mental illness, including aggressive and violent behavior, extreme paranoia, acute psychosis, delusions or delirium, and panic attacks. Users also may suffer an increased heart rate and vomiting.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="See footnote" class="footnote">14</a>  In 2011, an estimated 51,435 emergency room visits were linked to the abuse of synthetic drugs in the United States—55 percent of those due to synthetic marijuana and 45 percent due to bath salts.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="See footnote" class="footnote">15</a>  Further, in 2014, a total of 3,682 human exposures to synthetic marijuana were reported to poison control centers (American Association of Poison Control Centers, 2015).<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="See footnote" class="footnote">16</a>
</p>
<h2 id="prevalence-among-criminal-justice-involved-individuals">Prevalence among criminal justice-involved individuals</h2>
<p>Few studies have documented use of synthetic drugs within the criminal justice population. Researchers at the Center for Substance Abuse Research (CESAR) examined the Community Drug Early Warning System (<a href="%5C%5CMAINFILESRV%5Cr&a%5CLIBRARY%5CDrugs%20and%20Related%20Topics%5CSYNTHETIC%20DRUGS%5CWish%20et%20al.%20%282013%29%20CDEWS%20pilot.pdf">CDEWS</a>) for information on synthetic drug use.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="See footnote" class="footnote">17</a> CESAR tested CDEWS's ability to identify trends in newly available drugs. Researchers at CESAR analyzed urine specimens collected from participants to identify synthetic marijuana use in several criminal justice programs in Washington, D.C., Chesterfield, Va., and Prince George’s County, Md.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="See footnote" class="footnote">18</a> A total of 1,064 specimens were tested. Positive screens for synthetic marijuana among the following populations were found via CDEWS despite testing negative on other criminal justice drug screening panels:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>37 percent at the Washington, D.C., parole and probation site.</li>
	<li>28 percent at Washington, D.C., lockup.</li>
	<li>21 percent at the Washington, D.C., pretrial surveillance site.</li>
	<li>19 percent at Chesterfield probation.</li>
	<li>13 percent at Prince George’s County Drug Court.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="See footnote" class="footnote">19</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The likelihood of testing positive for synthetic marijuana was the same within the population regardless of basic drug testing outcomes.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="See footnote" class="footnote">20</a>
</p>
<p>The study was replicated (<a href="%5C%5CMAINFILESRV%5Cr&a%5CLIBRARY%5CDrugs%20and%20Related%20Topics%5CSYNTHETIC%20DRUGS%5CWish%20et%20al.%20%282015%29%20CDEWS%202%20replication%20study.pdf">CDEWS-2</a>) with juveniles and adults in Washington, D.C.; Denver, Colo.; and Tampa, Fla., and 1,026 urine specimens were collected. More than half of male probationers aged 21 to 30 years old tested positive for synthetic marijuana in Washington, D.C., despite passing the more limited criminal justice system drug screening panels (limited number of drugs screened). Additionally, 20 percent of juveniles aged 13 to 17 years old tested positive for synthetic marijuana in Washington, D.C.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="See footnote" class="footnote">21</a>  At the Denver Drug Court CDEWS site, a small portion of urine specimens tested positive for synthetic marijuana—8 percent of those who were positive on the limited drug panels and 3 percent of those who tested negative on the limited drug panels.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="See footnote" class="footnote">22</a>  Nine percent of juveniles’ urine specimens tested positive for synthetic marijuana; however, a majority of these specimens also tested positive for marijuana on the limited panels.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="See footnote" class="footnote">23</a>
</p>
<p>Most recently, the study was replicated in Hawaii (<a href="%5C%5CMAINFILESRV%5Cr&a%5CLIBRARY%5CDrugs%20and%20Related%20Topics%5CSYNTHETIC%20DRUGS%5CWish%20et%20al.%20%282016%29%20CDEWS%203-Hawaii.pdf">CDEWS-3</a>) with specimens from individuals in <a href="http://hopehawaii.net/">Hawaii’s Opportunity Probation Enforcement (HOPE)</a> program and general supervision populations in Honolulu.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="See footnote" class="footnote">24</a>  Out of the 194 HOPE and 143 general supervision specimens tested, 2 percent from HOPE and 1 percent from general supervision tested positive for synthetic marijuana. Those that tested positive for synthetic marijuana also tested negative for any drug in limited panels panels.<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="See footnote" class="footnote">25</a>
</p>
<h2 id="motivations-underlying-use">Motivations underlying use</h2>
<p>There are multiple reasons why individuals may try drugs, including the desire to take risks and try new things, and/or help deal with potential social or emotional problems—as relaxation or escape.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="See footnote" class="footnote">26</a>  In addition, drug availability, peer use, and family use are also factors that may influence an individual to engage in substance use.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="See footnote" class="footnote">27</a>  Other reported motivations for substance use include feeling better or feeling good, increasing self-confidence, decreasing boredom, satisfying curiosity, and enhancing other activities.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="See footnote" class="footnote">28</a>
</p>
<p>In a study of homeless, intravenous drug users in San Diego, Calif., 7 percent of the respondents reported trying bath salts and 30 percent reported trying synthetic marijuana. Of those who reported trying bath salts, the primary motivation to use was out of curiosity (58 percent). Those reporting synthetic marijuana use also indicated they were motivated by curiosity (49 percent). Further, individuals who had used synthetic marijuana were also motivated by availability, with 20 percent of respondents indicating synthetic marijuana was more available than other drugs.<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="See footnote" class="footnote">29</a>
</p>
<p>While that study found curiosity and availability were the primary motivators, some individuals reported unknowingly using synthetic drugs. An estimated quarter of those who had taken bath salts thought they were using another drug, such as methamphetamine.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="See footnote" class="footnote">30</a>  The study found a high rate of intravenous bath salt users within the sample, possibly because those individuals were already using drugs intravenously.<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="See footnote" class="footnote">31</a>  Further, both bath salt and synthetic marijuana users were more likely to report other drug use within the previous six months.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="See footnote" class="footnote">32</a>  This is consistent with research suggesting synthetic drug use is associated with general polysubstance use.<a href="#fn:33" id="fnref:33" title="See footnote" class="footnote">33</a>
</p>
<h2 id="synthetic-drug-availability-in-illinois">Synthetic drug availability in Illinois</h2>
<p>In 2016, the Authority completed a drug threat assessment survey of police chiefs and county sheriffs in Illinois. More than half of law enforcement respondents (n=82) reported <em>high</em> or <em>moderate</em> availability of synthetic marijuana (55 percent) and 35 percent reported <em>high</em> or <em>moderate</em> availability of bath salts in their jurisdictions (<em>Figure 1</em>).<a href="#fn:34" id="fnref:34" title="See footnote" class="footnote">34</a>  The perceived availability and demand for synthetic marijuana and bath salts was higher in the central and southern regions of Illinois.<a href="#fn:35" id="fnref:35" title="See footnote" class="footnote">35</a>  On the national level, synthetic marijuana and bath salts are moderately available compared to previous years. Further, the Chicago Drug Enforcement Agency Field Division reported lower availability in 2014 compared to 2013.<a href="#fn:36" id="fnref:36" title="See footnote" class="footnote">36</a>
</p>
<p>Illinois took steps to prevent access to and distribution of synthetic drugs with the Bath Salts Prohibition Act of 2016 [720 <em>ILCS</em> 542/), prohibiting the sale or offer of sale of bath salts at any retail establishment within the state. Violation of the Act is a Class 3 felony that may result in a fine of up to $150,000 and revocation of the retailer’s license.<br>

<p>Illinois law enforcement respondents reported perceived increases in synthetic drug transportation, distribution, demand, and availability within the past 12 months (<em>Figure 2</em>). Drug transportation refers to the movement of synthetic drugs from one place to another, such as into Illinois from other states or other countries.

</div>
<p>Indicating increased encounters with synthetic drugs use also has been indicated in emergency room visits. According to the Illinois Poison Center, between 2010 and 2011, bath salt cases increased 2,522 percent and synthetic marijuana cases increased 557 percent.<a href="#fn:37" id="fnref:37" title="See footnote" class="footnote">37</a>  More than half of the patients visiting emergency rooms for synthetic marijuana abuse were between the ages of 12 and 20 (56 percent).<a href="#fn:38" id="fnref:38" title="See footnote" class="footnote">38</a>  In Illinois, 85 percent of cases reported to the Illinois Poison Control Center that involved synthetic drugs in 2011 involved teens and young adults under the age of 30.<a href="#fn:39" id="fnref:39" title="See footnote" class="footnote">39</a></p>
<h2 id="current-study">Current study</h2>
<p>In April 2016, Authority researchers administered a paper survey to male inmates in two Illinois correctional facilities: Sheridan Correctional Center and the Adult Transition Center-Crossroads. All individuals surveyed were participating in substance abuse treatment with WestCare Foundation. The survey was designed to collect demographics and drug availability, prevalence/use, effects, and treatment.<a href="#fn:40" id="fnref:40" title="See footnote" class="footnote">40</a>  The final sample size was 562 individuals who completed the question regarding bath salt use and 558 individuals who completed questions regarding synthetic marijuana use.<a href="#fn:41" id="fnref:41" title="See footnote" class="footnote">41</a>  In total, 204 individuals reported any synthetic drug use.
</p>
<p>In addition, WestCare and Authority researchers matched survey participants with WestCare data. WestCare data consists of inmate clinical data reported by WestCare clinicians within the correctional facilities. The data includes inmate demographics as well as information from inmates’ Addiction Severity Index (ASI) assessment. The assessment was completed through one-on-one interviews with a WestCare clinician to develop a diagnostic impression of the client's severity of substance use, potential treatment problems, and other areas that may be affected by substance use. These areas included medical, employment, alcohol and drug, legal, family/social, and psychiatric problems. The ASI severity scores used for this analysis were developed by the Treatment Research Institute and are valid and reliable to measure severity ratings (extent of problem in each area) based on composite scores for each area of the ASI.<a href="#fn:42" id="fnref:42" title="See footnote" class="footnote">42</a>  WestCare clinician estimates of respondents’ need for treatment (ASI severity score) ranged from 0 (no treatment necessary) to 9 (treatment needed to intervene in life-threatening situation) based on severity scores calculated from the ASI treatment and manual guide.<a href="#fn:43" id="fnref:43" title="See footnote" class="footnote">43</a>
</p>
<p>Several limitations to this study are worth noting. First, individuals surveyed may have had difficulty recalling synthetic drug use prior to incarceration, particularly if it was not frequently used or not a drug of choice. Second, respondents may not always have known what drugs they were using and whether they were synthetic drugs. Third, participants may have been hesitant to provide truthful information because they were surveyed while residing in prison. Although participants were informed of their rights as human subjects and the confidential nature of their participation, some participants may have still had concerns over disclosing past illegal behaviors. Fourth, terms used in the survey, such as synthetic cathinones (bath salts) and synthetic cannabinoids (synthetic marijuana), may not have been fully understood by respondents, despite being provided with the definitions. Finally, the sample obtained was a convenience sample of those individuals at the two correctional facilities that were enrolled in substance abuse treatment with the WestCare Foundation; therefore, the findings are not generalizable to other populations.
</p>
<h2 id="sample-population-characteristics-of-synthetic-drug-users">Sample population characteristics of synthetic drug users</h2>
<p>Respondents who identified using synthetic marijuana and/or bath salts ranged in age from 19- to 56-years old, with an average age of 30-years old. Thirty-nine percent of the sample identified as Black/African American, 10 percent identified as Hispanic, and 35 percent identified as White/Caucasian. Respondents, on average, first tried drugs or alcohol at around age 13, and most frequently identified marijuana and alcohol as the first substances they ever tried, at 45 percent and 28 percent, respectively.
</p>
<p><em>Alcohol use.</em> Respondents had an average ASI alcohol severity score of 3.36 and a median score of 4.0, with a score of 5.0 as the most frequently reported score. This suggests that, on average, those who have used synthetic marijuana and/or bath salts were most frequently identified as having a slight to moderate problem with alcohol.  Respondents reported a median of five days of alcohol use within the previous 30-day period prior to incarceration. Over 60 percent of respondents reported no problem with alcohol within the 30 days prior to incarceration; however, 16 percent reported problems related to alcohol for the full 30 days prior to incarceration. Most respondents reported having no previous treatment for use of alcohol. Twenty-four percent of respondents indicated that alcohol treatment was extremely important, while 35 percent indicated it was not important at all.
</p>
<p><em>Drug use.</em> Respondents had an average ASI drug severity score of 4.45 and median score of 5.0, with a score of 5.0 as the most frequently reported score. This suggests that, on average, those who have used synthetic marijuana and/or bath salts were most frequently identified as having a moderate problem with drugs. Half of respondents reported having no problems with drugs in the 30 days prior to incarceration; however, 29 percent reported problems for the full 30-days prior to incarceration. The majority of respondents, 73 percent, indicated they had had no voluntary period of abstinence (in years). Most respondents reported having no previous treatment for drug use. Thirty-four percent of respondents identified that drug treatment was extremely important, while 14 percent of respondents identified that drug treatment was not important at all.
</p>
<h2 id="survey-results-on-synthetic-drug-use">Survey results on synthetic drug use</h2>
<h3>Prevalence of use</h3>
<p>Thirty-five percent of respondents reported using any synthetic drugs 12 months prior to incarceration (n=204). Of those surveyed, 29 percent reported use of synthetic marijuana  (n=166), 1 percent reported use of bath salts (n=6), and 6 percent reported using both bath salts and synthetic marijuana (n=32). (<em>Figure 3</em>). In total, 198 respondents reported any synthetic marijuana use and 38 respondents reported any bath salt use.

</div>
<h3>Methods of use</h3>
<p>Respondents (n=204) were asked to report the method(s) of synthetic drug use in the 12 months prior to incarceration. Smoking was the primary method of use reported for both synthetic marijuana and bath salts within the 12 months prior to incarceration. Almost all respondents who self-reported using synthetic marijuana smoked it (94 percent). Fifty percent of respondents who reported bath salt use in the 12 months prior to incarceration reported smoking it and 55 percent reported snorting it (<em>Figure 4</em>).

<h3>Reasons for use</h3>
<p>Of the 204 respondents who reported synthetic marijuana and/or bath salt use, the most commonly reported reasons for synthetic drug use were curiosity (n=133), to avoid positive drug tests (n=108), because they liked the effect (n=50), and to relax (n=59). These findings are consistent with the findings of other synthetic drug use studies, as more than half of respondents in a study of intravenous drug users reported using synthetic drugs out of curiosity (<em>Figure 5</em>).<a href="#fn:44" id="fnref:44" title="See footnote" class="footnote">44</a>  Less than 10 percent of respondents reported using synthetic drugs in order to stop using other drugs or because of peer pressure or health benefits.

</div>
<p>Respondents most commonly identified curiosity (54 percent), avoiding positive drug tests (47 percent), and relaxation (26 percent) as motivation to use (n=198). Those who self-reported any bath salt use (n=38) said curiosity (70 percent) and avoiding positive drug tests (35 percent) were their motivations.
</p>
<h3>Obtaining synthetic drugs</h3>
<p>Within the 12 months prior to incarceration, respondents (n=204) most frequently reported obtaining bath salts and synthetic marijuana from friends or relatives and from gas stations.  Less than 20 percent of respondents reported using the Internet to obtain synthetic drugs.
</p>
<p>Respondents who said they had used synthetic marijuana in the year prior to incarceration reported obtaining it from gas stations (54 percent) and friends or relatives (37 percent) (n=198). Of the 38 respondents who reported  bath salt use in the year prior to incarceration, 60 percent said they were obtained from gas stations and 40 percent got them from friends or relatives. (<em>Figure 6</em>).

<h3>Reported effects</h3>
<p>Respondents who reported synthetic marijuana use said the drug made them feel dizzy or lightheaded (55 percent), gave them a “pleasant high” (44 percent), and made them feel nervous/anxious (35 percent) (n=198). Respondents who reported bath salt use said it made their heart race (58 percent), gave them a “pleasant high” (55 percent), made them feel anxious/nervous (47 percent), and made them feel energized/stimulated (47 percent) (n=38).

<p>Chi-square and t-tests were performed to analyze the relationship between individual characteristics among surveyed inmates and the likelihood of synthetic drug use.<a href="#fn:45" id="fnref:45" title="See footnote" class="footnote">45</a> Researchers matched 476 of 556 clients with information and responses within the merged data and performed chi-square and t-tests. T-test and chi-square tests only included reported synthetic marijuana use as there were too few reports of bath salt use to measure.
</p>
<p>A relationship between client age and synthetic drug use was noted. Clients who were younger were more likely to report synthetic drug use than clients who were older. In addition, a relationship was seen between ASI drug severity score and synthetic drug use. Inmates with higher ASI drug severity scores were more likely to report synthetic drug use than those with lower ASI drug severity scores. Each of these characteristics had a moderate or noticeable effect on reported synthetic drug use.<a href="#fn:46" id="fnref:46" title="See footnote" class="footnote">46</a>
</p>
<p>In addition, an association was noted between race/ethnicity and reported synthetic drug use. White individuals were more likely to report synthetic drug use than Black and Hispanic individuals. While these analyses identified associations between these characteristics and reported synthetic drug use, they were relatively weak.<a href="#fn:47" id="fnref:47" title="See footnote" class="footnote">47</a>
</p>
<p>PTSD and probable PTSD severity scores also had a relationship to reported synthetic drug use. Those who reported synthetic drug use, on average, had a higher PTSD severity score than those who did not report synthetic drug use. A relatively weak association was seen between probable PTSD and reported synthetic drug use.

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>More than one-third of surveyed Sheridan Correctional Center and Adult Transition Center-Crossroads residents reported synthetic drug use in the 12 months prior to incarceration. On average, these individuals were around 30 years old, first tried drugs around the age of 13, and most frequently reported polysubstance use. In addition, most respondents reported trying or using synthetic drugs out of curiosity. These study results are consistent with other research findings on synthetic drug use.<a href="#fn:48" id="fnref:48" title="See footnote" class="footnote">48</a>  Research indicates a subset of the criminal justice population pass drug screening panels with a limited number of drugs tested while continuing to use synthetic drugs.<a href="#fn:49" id="fnref:49" title="See footnote" class="footnote">49</a>  In one study, active probation/parole status was highly associated with use of synthetic marijuana.<a href="#fn:50" id="fnref:50" title="See footnote" class="footnote">50</a> In several comprehensive CESAR studies on the CDEWS program, identification of synthetic marijuana in criminal justice-involved individuals rarely occurred. However, individuals who tested negative for any drug on the limited criminal justice drug panel screenings were more likely to test positive for synthetic marijuana via CDEWS.<a href="#fn:51" id="fnref:51" title="See footnote" class="footnote">51</a> It should be noted that CDEWS studies involve urine specimens taken from a population already at high risk for drug use and, therefore, may not be representative of the larger criminal justice population.<a href="#fn:52" id="fnref:52" title="See footnote" class="footnote">52</a>
</p>
<p>While some criminal justice-involved individuals do, in fact, evade detection of substance use by using synthetic drugs, some consideration for the cost of full drug screening panels is needed prior to changing policies and procedures.<a href="#fn:53" id="fnref:53" title="See footnote" class="footnote">53</a> Full panels can be costly. For example, one-, five-, and six-panel drug test kits cost around $22, $52, and $54 for a set of 25, respectively; 10- and 12-panel drug test kits cost around $91 and $112 dollars for a set of 25, respectively.<a href="#fn:54" id="fnref:54" title="See footnote" class="footnote">54</a>  It is important for community policymakers, stakeholders, and criminal justice professionals to consider the extent of synthetic drug use within their communities and weigh the costs and benefits of incorporating new policies and procedures to increase synthetic drug detection. The more sophisticated drug screens may be best left for those suspected of synthetic drug use, or they may be used sparingly to let individuals know of the potential for testing.<a href="#fn:55" id="fnref:55" title="See footnote" class="footnote">55</a>
