teaser: While more than half of individuals incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons meet the diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, little is known about their misuse of prescription drugs. In this study, Authority researchers, in collaboration with WestCare Foundation Illinois, surveyed 573 state prisoners on prescription drug use to examine prevalence, accessibility, motivation for use, and effects. Forty-six percent of the sample reported using prescription drugs to get high and 20 percent used prescription drugs daily in the year before their incarceration.

</p>
<h1>Study Overview</h1>
<p>In April 2016, Illinois Criminal Justice Authority (Authority) researchers, in collaboration with <a href="https://westcare.com/">WestCare Illinois</a>, administered a paper survey to 573 males residing in two Illinois correctional facilities receiving substance abuse treatment: Sheridan Correctional Center and Adult Transition Center-Crossroads. <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="See footnote" class="footnote">8</a> The survey collected information on demographics, prescription drug availability, prevalence/use, effects, and treatment.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="See footnote" class="footnote">9</a>  The survey documented prevalence, availability, motivation, and method of use of prescription drugs among incarcerated individuals.
</p>
<p>Authority researchers also matched participants to data collected by WestCare clinicians. The clinical data collected includes client demographic information and the <a href="http://www.tresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ASI_5th_Ed.pdf">Addiction Severity Index (ASI) assessment</a>.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="See footnote" class="footnote">10</a>  The ASI is an assessment tool developed by the <a href="http://www.tresearch.org/tools/for-clinicians/dens-software/">Treatment Research Institute</a> completed in one-on-one interviews with WestCare clinicians to create a diagnostic impression of client’s severity of substance use, potential treatment problems, and other life areas that may be impacted by substance use. These other areas include: medical, employment, alcohol and drug, legal, family/social, and psychiatric issues. WestCare clinician estimates of respondent needs for treatment were calculated into an ASI severity score, ranging from 0 (no treatment necessary) to 9 (treatment needed to intervene in life-threatening situation).<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="See footnote" class="footnote">11</a>
</p>
<p>Lastly, Authority researchers matched survey participants to their criminal history information using the Illinois State Police Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) database housed and maintained at the Authority. The study was approved by the Authority’s Institutional Review Board, the oversight body for all research involving human subjects.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>  All research studies have limitations, and this study was no  exception. First, individuals surveyed may have had difficulty recalling  prescription drug use prior to incarceration. Second, participants may have  been hesitant to provide truthful information because they were surveyed while  residing in prison. Although participants were informed of their rights as  research subjects including their right to confidentiality, some participants  may have still had concerns over disclosing past illegal drug behaviors. Third,  researchers obtained a convenience sample of individuals at the two  correctional facilities that were enrolled in substance abuse treatment with  the WestCare Foundation; therefore, the findings are not generalizable to other  populations or populations within the Illinois corrections system.</p>
<h1 id="main-findings">Main findings</h1>
<p>Of the 573 inmates surveyed, 46 percent (n=262) reported using prescription drugs to get high at some point in their lives prior to incarceration. Among the total sample surveyed (N=573), 25 percent were White, 48 percent were Black, and 11 percent were Hispanic. Respondents’ ages ranged from 19 to 63, with an average age of 35 years old and a median age of 33.
</p>
<p>Individuals in the full sample had, on average, 16 total prior arrests, with an average of five prior drug arrests and three prior violent arrests. There was a median of 14 prior arrests, with a median of four prior drug arrests and two prior violent arrests.
</p>
<h2>Respondents reporting prescription drug use</h2>
<p> Respondents reporting any prescription drug use in their lifetimes ranged from 19 to 62 years old, with an average age of 33 years old and a median age of 30 years old. Thirty-six percent of those who reported prescription drug use were White, 37 percent were Black/African American, and 10 percent were Hispanic.
</p>
<p>Survey responses and arrest records indicated 24 percent of respondents who reported any prescription drug use were serving time in corrections for drug charges. On average, these respondents had 16 prior arrests, averaging between five and six prior drug arrests and two to three prior violent arrests. Respondents had a median of 13 prior arrests, with a median of four prior drug arrests and two prior violent arrests. In their lifetimes, respondents reported serving an average of four years of incarceration, with a median of two years.
</p>
<h2>Type and frequency of drug use</h2>
<p>Although almost all of those surveyed had prior contact with the criminal justice system (82 percent), 32 percent of those who reported any prescription drug use reported never participating in prior drug or alcohol treatment (<em>Figure 1</em>). On average, respondents reported two prior treatment episodes, with a median of one prior treatment episode. There was a very weak, positive correlation between number of prior arrests and number of previous drug treatment episodes[<em>r</em>(260) = .162, p &lt; .05]. However, this association may be related to receiving treatment within a correctional setting; the majority identified previous treatment at a correctional facility. This suggests that more time spent in a correctional institution may provide more opportunities for access to some form of treatment or recovery support services.

	<p>On average, respondents who reported ever using prescription drugs in their lifetimes first tried alcohol or drugs when they were 12 or 13 years old. Marijuana and alcohol were the most commonly used drugs. Forty-three percent of respondents reported their first drug used was marijuana, 27 percent reported first trying alcohol, and 8 percent reported trying both marijuana and alcohol.
  </p>
	<p>On a scale of 0 (no treatment necessary) to 9 (immediate treatment to intervene in life-threatening situation), respondents had an average ASI alcohol severity score of 3, a median score of 4, and most frequent score of 5.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="See footnote" class="footnote">12</a>  The ASI alcohol severity score indicated that, on average, those who reported previous prescription drug use had a <em>slight</em> to <em>moderate</em> problem with alcohol. In addition, respondents had an average ASI drug severity score of 4 and a median score of 5, with 5 as the most frequent score reported. This, too, indicated that on average, respondents who reported previous prescription drug use had a <em>moderate</em> problem with drugs.
  </p>
	<p>Figure 2 lists the substances considered “major problems” by prisoners who reported any prescription drug use 12-months prior to incarceration. For 40 percent of respondents, alcohol and one or more other drugs (unspecified) were reported as the major problem and 21 percent reported multiple drugs (unspecified) were a major problem. This suggests that polysubstance use may be prevalent within substance using populations; however, researchers were unable to compare the two populations for this study.

							<h1>Summary</h1>
							<p>In this study of inmates in SUD treatment at Sheridan Correctional Center and ATC-Crossroads, 46 percent reported prescription drug misuse in the 12 months prior to incarceration. On average, these individuals were 32 years old (median of 31-years old), first tried drugs around the ages of 12 and 13 years old, and most frequently reported polysubstance use.
						  </p>
							<p>A majority of those who reported prescription drug use said they used them to relax and for their desirable effects. This is consistent with other research findings.
						  </p>
							<p>Sixty percent of prisoners in the sample reported obtaining prescription drugs from friends or relatives, indicating the need for education on the potential dangers of prescription drugs, appropriate storage, and proper disposal of unused prescriptions.
						  </p>
							<p>Opioids are one of the most highly abused prescription drugs, predominately used to manage pain.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="See footnote" class="footnote">13</a>  However, opioids activate a region in the brain that causes euphoria and the sample most frequently identified euphoria as a reason for prescription drug use.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="See footnote" class="footnote">14</a>  Central nervous system depressants, which also are highly abused, result in drowsiness or a calming effect.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="See footnote" class="footnote">15</a>  This is consistent with the current study findings that majority of those who reported prescription drug use did so to relax.
						  </p>
							<p>The link between offending and substance use is well documented.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="See footnote" class="footnote">16</a>  This suggests that appropriate evidence-informed treatment should be incorporated into corrections and prison and jail re-entry programs, including the use of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders when appropriate. <a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="See footnote" class="footnote">17</a>
						  </p>
							<p>Close to half of the prisoners in the sample misused prescription drugs, raising concerns of continued misuse during imprisonment. It is well documented that prisoners find ways to obtain illegal drugs, including prescriptions, despite security measures in place to prevent drugs from entering prison.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="See footnote" class="footnote">18</a> Continued diligence is needed to thwart prescription drug diversion and misuse within the prison system.
