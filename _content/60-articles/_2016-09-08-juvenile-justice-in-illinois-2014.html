<p class="drop">High profile crimes committed by juveniles tend to influence public perception of juvenile crime.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="See footnote" class="footnote">1</a> National and Illinois data, however, show juvenile crime has dropped over the last 10 years.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="See footnote" class="footnote">2</a> Only 2 percent of the juvenile population was arrested in 2014 and fewer moved deeper into the system.

<p>Authority researchers used data to provide an overview of Illinois juvenile justice system processes for 2014, with 10-year trend analyses when possible. Processing points examined included: arrest, detention, court, and corrections. The analyses revealed decreases in the statewide figures across all of the data points examined, indicating that fewer youth were entering and moving through the juvenile justice system in 2014 than 10 years ago. Below are some of the specific key findings noted.
