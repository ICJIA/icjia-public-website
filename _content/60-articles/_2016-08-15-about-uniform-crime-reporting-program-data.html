<p>The official source of nationwide crime data is the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, which provides data that can be used to examine trends over time as well as current patterns. Even so, there are some limitations to UCR data, and researchers studying crime trends using UCR data must know the source of their data, the method of its collection, and any caveats needed to put trends suggested by the data in context. The information summarized in this article provides an introduction to state and federal UCR data.</p>



<h2 id="the-uniform-crime-reporting-ucr-program">The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program </h2>

<p>The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program is a voluntary, nationwide law enforcement data collection program maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The UCR’s goals include (1) generating data that can inform law enforcement policy and planning; and (2) offering information about crime to government agencies, criminal justice researchers, the media, and the public. More than 18,000 law enforcement agencies—including state, county, tribal, and local police departments, as well as police agencies serving railroads, forest preserves, universities and colleges, park districts, and hospitals—report crime data to the FBI. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police (ISP) is responsible for submitting data gathered from Illinois law enforcement agencies to the FBI.  </p>

<p>In 2015, the FBI collected offense and arrest data through the UCR program from law enforcement agencies in 50 states as well as American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a> Data were collected on Part 1 Index crimes—violent and property crimes that occur with regular frequency and are likely to come to the attention of police. These Part 1 Index crimes are categorized into two types:</p>

<ol>
<li>violent index offenses, which include murder/non-negligent manslaughter; rape; robbery;<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2">2</a> and aggravated assault; </li>
<li>property index offenses, which include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.   </li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to submitting arrest data on Part 1 crimes, some law enforcement agencies across the country also provide data on Part 2 crimes, which are less serious than Part 1 crimes and encompass all other offenses.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:4" href="#fn:4">3</a> Data on Part 2 crimes is not collected by the Illinois State Police and therefore not submitted to the FBI.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:5" href="#fn:5">4</a>

</p><p>Several changes have been made since the inception of the program: The FBI added hate crime data to the program in 1990 and data concerning human trafficking-related crimes—i.e., those involving commercial sex acts and involuntary servitude—in 2013.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:6" href="#fn:6">5</a> The definition of forcible rape was also expanded in 2014 to cover male victims as well as other forms of penetration other than penile/vaginal.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:7" href="#fn:7">6</a>

</p><p>Once compiled, the FBI publishes UCR data in <em>Crime in the U.S.</em>, an annual report that summarizes the findings and arranges the data in tables. Criminal justice policy makers, criminal justice practitioners, and the public rely on the information contained in Crime in the U.S. to broaden their comprehension of national crime trends.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:8" href="#fn:8">7</a> At the same time, state agencies rely on the report to better understand—and disseminate information on—state crime trends. For example, the ISP draws on UCR data in its annual report Crime in Illinois, which summarizes Illinois data and publishes the data by county and law enforcement agency. Illinois county-level UCR data are also available on the Authority website. </p>



<h2 id="the-ucr-program-data-reporting-methods">The UCR Program: Data reporting methods</h2>

<p>The UCR program includes four data collection subprograms used to gather data and generate annual reports: the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS); the Summary Reporting System (SRS); the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) Program; and the Hate Crime Statistics Program.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:9" href="#fn:9">7</a>

</p><p>The UCR program relies especially on NIBRS and SRS to collect crime data by law enforcement agencies. NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system that allows agencies to collect detailed data on crime, including victim and offender demographics and incident information for all reported offenses.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:10" href="#fn:10">8</a> SRS, on the other hand, allows law enforcement agencies to tally the number of occurrences of Part 1 offenses as well as the arrest data for both Part 1 and Part 2 offenses. Agencies can then generate and submit aggregate counts to the FBI via monthly reports. Data from all sources are available through <em>Crime in the U.S.</em> </p>

<p>In total, 26 states submit data to the UCR program via NIBRS.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:11" href="#fn:11">9</a> While 24 states currently use SRS to submit data to the FBI, 12 states are in the process of testing NIBRS for use in the near future, and eight are in the planning and development stage of implementing NIBRS.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:12" href="#fn:12">10</a> In general, Illinois law enforcement agencies use SRS to report to ISP; ISP then reports to the FBI also via SRS. However, the FBI prefers that agencies report their data via NIBRS, as it provides the most detailed information, and for this reason the FBI has mandated that all states use NIBRS by 2021. Thus, Illinois will likely shift from reporting data through SRS to doing so via NIBRS sometime in the next few years.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:13" href="#fn:13">11</a>

</p>

<h2 id="the-ucr-program-limitations">The UCR Program: Limitations</h2>

<p>While data from the UCR program are considered a reliable and comprehensive source of information, there are some limitations to its use. First, only specific violent and property crimes are reported to the UCR program, despite the occurrence of any other type of crime that may come to the attention of police.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:14" href="#fn:14">12</a> Second, not all crimes that are committed are reported to police, meaning that available data may misrepresent actual crime rates. Third, agencies use the “hierarchy rule,” which stipulates that only the most serious offense committed during a criminal incident be reported. For instance, offenders may commit and be charged with multiple law violations during one incident, but only the most serious violation is reported through the I-UCR Program. Fourth, lack of reporting or irregular reporting by states can limit the accuracy of UCR data, while technological problems, data system changes, and staff turnover may also prevent agencies from reporting accurately or even reporting at all.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:15" href="#fn:15">13</a> UCR data thus undercounts the actual occurrences of crime. Finally, certain subprograms—like the SRS—do not allow data on individual incidents, age, race, or gender to be submitted, meaning that the data compiled by states that use the SRS exclusively (like Illinois) are incomplete.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:16" href="#fn:16">14</a> Because of these limitations, the crime trends suggested by UCR data may not be representative of the entire population or reflect the true occurrence of crime.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:17" href="#fn:17">15</a>

</p>

<h2 id="the-illinois-ucr-i-ucr-program">The Illinois UCR (I-UCR) Program</h2>

<p>In 1969, a state law was passed requiring ISP to collect Part 1 Index crime data from all Illinois law enforcement agencies on a monthly basis<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:18" href="#fn:18">16</a>  [20 <em>ILCS</em> 2630/8].<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:19" href="#fn:19">17</a>

</p>

<h2 id="the-i-ucr-program-changes-to-data">The I-UCR Program: Changes to data</h2>

<p>In the past two decades, ISP has expanded the range of data compiled in I-UCR: </p>

<ul>

<li>In 1994, ISP began requiring that law enforcement agencies report drug arrest data to I-UCR.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:20" href="#fn:20">18</a> </li>
<li>In 1996, ISP mandated submission of data recording domestic offenses, attacks against school personnel, and hate crimes. It also asked that crimes against children be voluntarily reported, but data collection on crimes against children ended in 2013 to lessen the workload for reporting agencies.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:21" href="#fn:21">19</a> </li>
<li>In 2014, ISP added two human trafficking crime categories to the UCR Program: commercial sex acts and involuntary servitude.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:22" href="#fn:22">20</a> </li>
<li>In 2014, the Federal UCR Program expanded the definition of rape to include sex offenses that involve penetration of any body part (not just a vagina) with any object (not just a penis), and victims and offenders of the same sex.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:23" href="#fn:23">21</a> </li>
<li>In 2014, ISP expanded its category of crimes against school personnel to include data on intimidation, drug use, and firearm incidents in schools.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:24" href="#fn:24">22</a></li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2 id="the-i-ucr-program-other-recent-developments">The I-UCR Program: Other recent developments</h2>

<p>It is worth noting a few recent developments regarding the I-UCR and its data. First, fewer Illinois agencies reported data to ISP in 2015 than in previous years because some reporting agencies were not able to make the necessary definition and hierarchal changes to their reporting systems.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:25" href="#fn:25">23</a> Specifically, these agencies either could not add crimes to criminal categories (for example, the additional forms of assault now included in the rape category) or adjust their systems to report only the most serious offense in an incident. Second, data submitted by those agencies that did not follow federal definitions and guidelines were excluded from <em>Crime in Illinois, 2015</em>.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:26" href="#fn:26">24</a> Third, between 2005 and 2015, the number of reporting agencies dropped 34 percent, from 1,119 to 741 (<em>Figure</em>), probably due to a number of law enforcement agencies closing, merging with one another, or being unable to comply with reporting requirements.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:27" href="#fn:27">25</a> Even so, the three-quarters of all the Illinois agencies that submitted data in 2015 accounted for 98 percent of the state population,<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:28" href="#fn:28">26</a> which was same as the percent representation in past years (2010-2013). Most of the agencies that did not report data were likely based in less populated jurisdictions. Hence, the decrease in the number of reporting agencies likely had a minimal impact on the reliability and generalizability of the data.</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-implications-for-policy-and-practice">Summary and Implications for policy and practice</h2>

<p><em>Crime in Illinois</em> is considered the state’s official source of crime statistics and provides the most comprehensive data available. Although there are limitations to the I-UCR data, most of Illinois’ population is represented, and the data are, for the most part, reported correctly.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:29" href="#fn:29">27</a> Accurate and reliable I-UCR data reporting by all local law enforcement agencies allows policymakers to identify and address crime trends across the state. Agencies that properly report data enjoy the added advantage of being eligible for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funding. </p>

<p>Two practical changes would strengthen the I-UCR Program. First, the FBI provides guidelines to law enforcement agencies on proper data collection.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:30" href="#fn:30">28</a> ISP should offer training on these UCR guidelines regularly to law enforcement agencies, and especially those agencies that have reported data incorrectly.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:31" href="#fn:31">29</a> Second, beginning in 2021, UCR data will be accepted by the FBI only through NIBRS; therefore, action toward statewide NIBRS implementation should be undertaken by local law enforcement agencies.<a title="See footnote" class="footnote" id="fnref:32" href="#fn:32">30</a> Once most reporting is conducted through NIBRS, criminal justice practitioners will have access to detailed information that will allow them to more closely examine trends and issues emerging in the criminal justice system. </p>
