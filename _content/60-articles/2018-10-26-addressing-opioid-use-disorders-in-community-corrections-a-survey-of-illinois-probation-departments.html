<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Many probationers suffer from opioid use disorders (OUD). In a 2016 national survey of drug courts, 22 percent of respondents indicated opioids as their clients’ primary substance of abuse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>    Similar rates of opioid use are seen in Illinois among criminal justice-involved individuals. Nine Adult Redeploy Illinois-funded mental health and drug court programs in 10 counties reported 33 percent of participants had an opioid use disorder (n=42). 
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Despite the evidence that the use of medications for OUD is effective, some probation departments do not allow their clients to use these medications even when prescribed by a healthcare provider.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) researchers surveyed probation departments in the state to better understand their familiarity with, training on, and barriers to probation clients accessing and using the three FDA-approved medications
    for OUD. This article summarizes the study’s findings.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
<p>Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronic, relapsing, clinically diagnosed conditions. Unlike other SUD,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> but similar to other chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, OUD can be addressed
    with medication and behavioral therapy referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT). However, despite being the gold standard, two medications—methadone  and buprenorphine—are frequently untapped, due to preconceived notions about using an opioid medication for treatment and
    past experiences.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> Criminal justice practitioners who work with clients with       OUD should understand the different treatment       options that exist as research indicates that treatment adherence and       long-term effectiveness are predicated on individualized responses. In other words, no single treatment modality works for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-medication-assisted-treatment">What is Medication-Assisted Treatment?</h3>
<p>Medication-assisted treatment combines behavioral therapy with any one of three FDA-approved medications for OUD—methadone, buprenorphine (most common brand name, Suboxone®, which has both buprenorphine and naloxone in a single
    film), and injectable naltrexone (brand name Vivitrol®).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Methadone and buprenorphine have been shown to help individuals reduce overdose, illicit drug use, crime commission, and transmission
    of infectious diseases.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> The two medications also are associated with a reduction in cravings, increased retention in treatment, increased social functioning, improved health outcomes,
    and reduced recidivism. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> Injectable naltrexone has been shown to reduce illicit drug use and extend time to relapse. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup>    Although oral naltrexone is available, it has not been shown to increase retention in treatment or affect other outcomes and is not recommended for treatment of opioid use disorder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>    Like medication for other chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone can help stabilize individuals so they can successfully maintain long-term recovery, as well as  aid in breaking the cycle of offending.

</p>

<h3 id="methadone-and-buprenorphine-should-clients-take-those-medications">Methadone and Buprenorphine: Should Clients Take These Medications?</h3>
<p>Methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, though unlike most opioids that are misused, they have very long periods of effectiveness, and when dosed appropriately, individuals feel an increased sense of stability and reduced cravings. This allows them to
    focus on other recovery-oriented activities.</p>
<p>Physical withdrawal, often accompanied by cravings, is a major challenge for individuals with OUD, even for those who are committed to recovery. Methadone and buprenorphine ease physical withdrawal symptoms. As with other medications, some clients experience
    a period of trial and error in finding the right drug and dosage. Other clients may be reluctant to take an opioid-based medication as part of their treatment plan because of preexisting beliefs that favor “abstinence-only” treatment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup>    But these medications do not “replace one addiction for another.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> Instead they boost restoration of the brain’s chemical balance for stabilization, allowing for increased participation
    in treatment (e.g., medical/physical, psychological), while enhancing an individual’s overall well-being. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> Unlike heroin and other opioids that include a rapid onset and short duration
    of action in the brain, methadone and buprenorphine have more gradual onsets and produce stable levels of what is otherwise a naturally occurring chemical in the brain. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Methadone</strong> is a full-agonist synthetic opioid that activates opioid receptors in the brain, helping to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms while blocking euphoric effects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>    Methadone is administered in a pill, liquid, or wafer form. When receiving treatment for OUD, federal regulation requires that individuals receive methadone from highly regulated and licensed Opioid Treatment Programs, certified and accredited by
    the federal government <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> (methadone can be prescribed for pain in office settings, but not for OUD treatment). Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) does not require
    detoxification from opioids to initiate treatment but does require regular visits to the treatment program, with more frequent visits in the early phases of treatment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> Methadone
    regulations mandate “observed dosing” of individuals in early recovery, with a nurse watching the client take the medication. This regulation reduces the risk of diversion—or the client selling or giving their prescribed medication to others. Over
    time, clients with increased stability in their recovery may obtain “take home doses.” The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends a minimum of 12 months of MMT; however, length of treatment can last years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>Research examining the effectiveness of methadone indicates those who remain in treatment and continue to use methadone have lower rates of relapse and death due to opioid use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> MMT
    is recommended for people with moderate to severe OUD and is most effective among those with a history of chronic opioid use.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> Research also indicates that those
    who are justice-involved and participating in methadone treatment fare better than their counterparts receiving other types of treatment. Specifically, those on methadone have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A higher average number of days in community-based treatment.</li>
    <li>Higher rate of retention in treatment programming.</li>
    <li>Decreased involvement in crime and illicit drug use.</li>
    <li>Decreased rate of infectious disease.</li>
    <li>Decreased mortality upon release from prison or jail.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Buprenorphine</strong> is a partial agonist offering a “ceiling effect,” after which increased use of the medication provides no additional effect. This reduces the likelihood of overdose, even at extremely high doses.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>    Buprenorphine comes in many forms, though the most common are a film or tablet that is placed under the tongue. Other approved formulations include a film that dissolves along the inside of the cheek, six-month implant, and month-long injectable.
    The transdermal buprenorphine patch that is approved for pain treatment only.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine formulations include sublingual (under the tongue), buccal film (inside cheek), and a subdermal implant.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> Sublingual and buccal film can add naloxone (an antagonist). Naloxone
    is a medication used to reverse an opioid overdose. The naloxone is added to these formulations to discourage people from injecting the medication. When these formulations are melted down and injected, the naloxone component becomes active, which
    can result in immediate withdrawal. If an individual takes the medication as prescribed, the naloxone is not active. If an individual uses other opiates while taking buprenorphine as prescribed, the high will be blunted because most of the opioid receptors
    in the brain will already be occupied.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like methadone, buprenorphine reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms. An important difference between buprenorphine and methadone is that it can be prescribed by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant in an office, hospital, health
    department, or correctional facility. The medical provider<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> must complete training administered by an approved educational provider and then obtain a special license or waiver with
    credentials verified and approved by the federal government. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Research indicates that buprenorphine can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increase treatment retention and acceptance of community-based treatment post-release from an institutional facility.</li>
    <li>Decrease heroin use, increase social functioning and overall well-being, reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.</li>
    <li>Decrease mortality.</li>
    <li>Reduce potential contraction of HIV or hepatitis B or C.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="naltrexone-how-is-it-different-from-the-other-mat-medications">Naltrexone: How is it Different from the Other MAT Medications?</h3>
<p><strong>Naltrexone</strong> is a full antagonist, blocking the opioid receptors that adhere to heroin and other opioids. Injectable extended-release naltrexone lasts approximately 28 days.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup>    If someone is taking naltrexone and uses an opioid, the naltrexone prevents the individual from experiencing the effects of the opioid.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Less empirical evidence is available on this
    recently approved injectable; however, early studies show that injectable naltrexone can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Help maintain abstinence.</li>
    <li>Increase retention in treatment.</li>
    <li>Reduce cravings (though with some slight increases prior to subsequent injections).</li>
    <li>Prevent relapse.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals can get an injection of naltrexone following a seven- to 10-day, medically managed withdrawal period (also referred to as “detox”). This requirement makes it much more difficult for some individuals to successfully initiate naltrexone-based
    MAT.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Naltrexone also comes in a pill form that can be taken daily, but this formulation has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of OUD.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> Naltrexone can be a good option for
    individuals who prefer a non-opioid relapse prevention medication.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>Results from a recent study comparing buprenorphine and naltrexone found that individuals who were successfully inducted on either medication had similar outcomes, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A decrease in relapse.</li>
    <li>An increase in number of opioid-abstinent days.</li>
    <li>A decrease in self-reported cravings.</li>
</ul>
<p>This research also explored the difficulty individuals had in successfully initiating naltrexone because of the required seven- to 10-day abstinence period.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup> Of the 570 participants who intended
    to start treatment (n=283 for naltrexone; n=287 for buprenorphine):</p>
<ul>
    <li>94 percent successfully started buprenorphine (n=270).</li>
    <li>72 percent successfully started naltrexone (n=204) and had a larger percentage of relapse events than did those starting buprenorphine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The association between naltrexone and reduction in mortality has not been studied, nor has the optimal length for individuals to remain on naltrexone. Current medical guidelines suggest injectable naltrexone treatment may be continued if the patient
    is benefitting from it and there are no contraindications to continuing the medication.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="behavorial-therapy">Behavorial Therapy</h3>
<p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) recommends combining medication to treat OUD with counseling, behavioral therapies, and other supportive services (e.g., vocational, educational, medical, housing, mental health).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>    SAMHSA’s new clinical guidelines suggest patients should be offered and referred to counseling and behavioral therapy but that medications should not be withheld if counseling services are not available. Research indicates offering medication
    alone to those on waiting lists for counseling and behavioral therapies resulted in far less illicit opioid use compared to individuals waiting without medications.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup> Medications become
    a bridge while clients are on waiting lists for therapy, reducing chances for infectious disease, relapse, and overdose.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Research demonstrates that cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are highly effective in reducing substance use and abuse and reoffending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup> CBT can be used in
    any setting, including, but not limited to, individual, family, or group-based formats; residential and inpatient facilities; and outpatient or intensive outpatient programs. CBT focuses on two key aspects:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Thought processes, attitudes, and values underlying problematic behavior (cognitive).</li>
    <li>Observable behaviors (behavioral).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Individuals increase their understanding of how thoughts and feelings influence behavior choices while participating in discussion and practice about alternative thinking and behaviors. CBT generally incorporate some combination of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Restructuring maladaptive thinking.</li>
    <li>Social skill building.</li>
    <li>Emotional regulation skills.</li>
    <li>Behavioral rehearsal (skill practice, including skill-based homework).</li>
    <li>Motivational enhancement techniques.</li>
    <li>Contingency management principles.</li>
    <li>Psychoeducation.</li>
    <li>Systematic training of alternative responses to high-risk situations (commonly known as “triggers”).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of evidence-based CBT programs include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Thinking for a Change (T4C).</li>
    <li>Relapse Prevention (RP).</li>
    <li>Voucher-Based Reinforcement Therapy (VBRT) or Prize-Based (PB) contingency management.</li>
    <li>Trauma-informed programs, such as Seeking Safety, Trauma Affect Regulation; Guide for Education and Therapy (TARGET), and Trauma, Addiction, Mental Health, and Recovery (TAMAR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the goals of CBT are to enhance appropriate social and emotional skills, develop and use interpersonal skills, target maladaptive thinking patterns, increase self-efficacy and critical thinking, and learn to manage or cope with risky situations.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> Alongside behavioral therapy and counseling, peer-recovery support services can be helpful in building a social support system and sustaining progress made in behavioral therapy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup>        Peer recovery support services include, but are not limited to, SMART Recovery, recovery coaches, and 12-step groups, (Alcoholics Anonymous [AA], Narcotics Anonymous [NA]).</p>

<h2 id="current-study">Current Study</h2>
<p>ICJIA researchers conducted a survey of Illinois probation departments to learn more about how they respond to probationers with OUD. Specifically, researchers sought to gauge probation departments’ level of familiarity with, and training on, MAT and
    OUD medications. In addition, researchers explored respondents’ openness to referring probation clients to MAT and the barriers for clients to access MAT. Below is detail on the methodology employed, survey findings, and implications for probation
    departments.</p>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Researchers emailed an online survey to a list of Illinois probation department directors in March 2018 from an <a href="http://ipcsa.org/il-probation-directory">Illinois Probation and Court Services Association directory</a>. Researchers conducted survey
    reminders by phone and email from June to August 2018. The survey was closed and the data downloaded for analysis on August 30, 2018.</p>
<p>The research study was approved by ICJIA’s Institutional Review Board. All respondents were required to review a consent form and agree to participate in the study. The survey consisted of 32 questions and was made available online using Qualtrics survey
    software. Some questions were taken from a similar national study of criminal justice practitioners, the Criminal Justice-Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> Data were analyzed
    with Microsoft Excel and SPSS statistical software.</p>
<p>A total of 31 responses were received; however, five survey responses were excluded because more than one individual responded for their department (one survey per department was requested). The five respondents were eliminated based on 1) whether the
    respondent was the chief or director of probation (preferred respondent) or 2) randomly excluding those not submitted by the probation chief or director. The final sample size was 26 respondents representing 38 out of 102 Illinois counties (37 percent)
    but only 26 percent of probation departments. Many respondents represented counties with large probation caseloads, so the sample managed 72 percent of <a href="http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/SupremeCourt/AnnualReport/2016/2016_Statistical_Summary.pdf">2016 active adult probation caseloads in Illinois</a>.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> In addition, respondents’ counties had a relatively high number of opioid overdose deaths, representing 83 percent of all <a href="http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Drug-Overdose-Deaths-Aug2018.pdf">opioid overdose deaths in Illinois in 2017, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health</a>.
        <sup
            class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup> <em>Tables 1</em> and <em>2</em> offer more detail on the sample.</p>
<p>This study was limited by a low response rate of 26 percent, which may impact the generalizability of study findings; therefore, findings do not represent the views of all probation departments in the state. Although the response rate is somewhat low, similar
    online surveys have yielded an average response rate of 10 to 15 percent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> Therefore, the response rate was not uncommon for an online survey of professionals. Despite the lower response
    rate, still represented were counties that have relatively high numbers of opioid overdose deaths.</p>
<p>In addition, two counties sent survey responses based on their drug courts, rather than reporting on the scope of all probation services. Three respondents reported from circuits representing more than one county. It is unknown whether each county within
    those circuits would have had the same responses to the survey and whether drug court staff respondents are representative of the larger probation department.</p>

<h3 id="main-findings">Main Findings</h3>
<p>Ninety-two percent (n=24) of survey respondents reported a <em>moderate</em> to <em>serious</em> problem with opioid misuse in their counties and 8 percent reported opioid misuse as a <em>slight</em> problem (n=2). The following are additional findings
    from the survey of probation departments.</p>

<h4>Knowledge of medications</h4>
<p>The respondents representing probation departments were asked to indicate their levels of familiarity of use, effectiveness, administration, and “how it works” for each of the three FDA-approved medications for
    the treatment of OUD—methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. <em>Figure 1</em> depicts responses of very to <em>extremely familiar</em>. Respondents indicated knowing slightly less about methadone in terms of use, effectiveness, administration,
    and how it works, compared to buprenorphine and naltrexone.</p>

<p>Most respondents reported being <em>moderately</em> familiar with aspects of buprenorphine. Nearly one-third of respondents were <em>slightly</em> or <em>not at all familiar</em> with how buprenorphine is administered (32 percent) and how it works (32
    percent) and 43 percent reported being <em>very</em> or <em>extremely familiar</em> with how to use buprenorphine (<em>Figure 3</em>).</p>

<p>Most probation department respondents reported being at least <em>moderately</em> familiar with naltrexone use, effectiveness, and administration. Almost half of respondents were <em>extremely</em> or <em>very familiar</em> with how naltrexone is used/its
    purpose (47 percent) and how it works (43 percent); however less than one-third considered themselves <em>extremely</em> or <em>very familiar</em> with the efficacy of naltrexone (30 percent).</p>

<h4>Training on medications</h4>
<p>Respondents who were mostly probation department directors were asked to report on training on OUD medications for themselves as well as their staff. Overall, the amount of training was low with more training
    on naltrexone than buprenorphine or methadone (<em>Figure 5</em>). Sixty-five percent of respondents were <em>extremely</em> or <em>moderately</em> interested in further MAT training (n=17).</p>

<p>Most respondents, speaking on behalf of themselves and their staff, received training from outside consultants (38 percent and 45 percent, respectively) (<em>Table 3</em>). One respondent indicated staff received training from pharmaceutical sales representatives.
    It is possible that respondents considered sales representatives as outside consultants or that training as part of conferences/events was provided by sales representatives.</p>

<h4>Client referrals for medication-assisted treatment</h4>
<p>Respondents were asked to report on referrals for MAT from their own perspective, as well as on behalf of their staff. According to respondents, a high percentage of their staff were
    <em>extremely</em> or <em>very</em> open to referring clients to naltrexone treatment (91 percent). Many also were <em>extremely</em> or <em>very</em> open to referring clients to buprenorphine treatment (77 percent) and methadone treatment (59 percent) (<em>Figure</em>    6).</p>

<p>A large majority of respondents would <em>allow</em> clients on their probation caseloads to be on buprenorphine (96 percent), naltrexone (96 percent), and methadone (92 percent). This is in sharp contrast to the results of a 2013 national study in which
    40 percent of drug court respondents with clients on probation would allow clients to continue methadone or buprenorphine. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup></p>

<h4>Barriers to medication-assisted treatment</h4>
<p>Sixty-one percent of respondents indicated MAT barriers existed to a <em>moderate</em> to <em>very great extent</em>. <em>Figure</em> 7 depicts the types of probation client barriers to MAT,
    as reported by survey respondents. The most common barriers cited were lack of medical personnel experience (73 percent) and cost (50 percent). Further, 23 percent reported that regulations within their organization or jurisdiction prohibited using medications
    for SUD.</p>

<p>One respondent commented, “MDs tend to pick a medication and stick to it. Ours is not a big proponent of Vivitrol [naltrexone] but uses Suboxone.” This suggests that medication choice may be dependent on individual doctor preferences. Another noted, “Our
    small, rural community has no providers who offer MAT,” indicating that access to evidence-based substance use disorder treatment may vary depending on location or region. Lack of access impacts the jurisdiction’s ability to appropriately and adequately
    address justice-involved clients’ needs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-implications-for-probation">Conclusion and Implications for Probation</h2>
<p>Although MAT is not for everyone and treatment must be an individualized decision between a patient and his or her doctor, access to the three forms of FDA-approved medications to treat OUD in conjunction with therapy can help slow the trajectory of the current
    opioid crisis and save lives.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup> MAT has been proven effective for helping justice-involved individuals with OUD. Studies have shown all three MAT medications have reduced illicit
    drug use and recidivism reductions with methadone and buprenorphine. These outcomes are enhanced through collaboration with social service, behavioral health, and public health providers. Increasing access to this evidence-based strategy can help
    individuals successfully complete supervision and become productive members of society, while enhancing quality of life and potentially saving lives.</p>

<h3 id="address-barriers-to-mat-for-the-treatment-of-probation-clients-with-opioid-use-disorders">Address Barriers to MAT for the Treatment of Probation Clients with Opioid Use Disorders</h3>
<p>Barriers noted by surveyed probation departments in Illinois included lack of institutional knowledge, need for guidance, cost, and lack of experience by medical personnel. Some barriers can be addressed by probation departments through education
    and training. Other barriers can be overcome through collaboration with clients, healthcare providers, substance use and mental health treatment providers, probation and court services agencies, and other social service agencies. <em>Table 4</em>    provides common barriers and concerns about MAT programs and suggestions for how these can be addressed.</p>

  <p>- Methadone and buprenorphine are highly regulated. Buprenorphine overdose is very rare because of the “ceiling effect.” In cases in which it is involved in an overdose, other drugs that also slow breathing are typically involved (for example, alcohol, benzodiazepines).</p>
