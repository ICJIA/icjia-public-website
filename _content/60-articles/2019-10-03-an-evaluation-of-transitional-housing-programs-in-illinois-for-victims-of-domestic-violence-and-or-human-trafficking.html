  <h2 id="appendix-program-site-descriptions">Appendix: Program Site Descriptions</h2>
  <p>This appendix offers detailed descriptions of the programming and operations of the three sites that were the focus of this evaluation.</p>
  <h3 id="site-a">Site A</h3>
  <p>Program Site A was a domestic violence service provider that operated a transitional housing program in a suburban county in the Chicago metropolitan area. The program offered services to victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. This program employed a scattered site model with capacity to provide assistance for 30 housing units; 22 units were in use at the time of the staff interviews (June 2018). Rental assistance was provided by the program for up to two years. Participants were required to have an income to be eligible for this program.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Prospective applicants often learned of the program while in the site’s emergency shelter, were referred by an outside organization (e.g., hospital, law enforcement), or had called a hotline seeking services. Applicants were required to write a letter describing their abusive situations and how the program would benefit them and submit it with either an order of protection<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> or two witness letters from individuals who corroborated the occurrence of domestic violence. The program accepted clients who had experienced a domestic violence or human trafficking incident within the past year. Some exceptions to these requirements were made in the event it was not feasible for a victim to provide the necessary documentation.</p>
  <p>During the intake process for transitional housing, the client met with a case manager in person to learn more about the program and ask any questions about the program. Clients worked with a case manager to complete a housing assessment, a human trafficking assessment (if warranted), and a budget worksheet. Although optional, safety plans and service plans for all clients were created as soon as possible during their work with the agency.</p>
  <p>When an applicant was approved, the amount of their rental assistance was determined based on household size, income, and market rate of housing units in their chosen area. With this information, clients worked with their case managers to search for housing units and submit applications to landlords. With client permission, case managers reached out to the potential landlords to explain the program and advocate on behalf of the client during the application process. Clients held leases in their own names; the program provided a rider to the lease that outlined the relationship between the program, client, and landlord, including the program’s rent contributions and any other responsibilities.</p>
  <p>Clients were required to engage in case management on a regular basis, continue participation in any ongoing voluntary services (e.g., counseling), maintain an income, and make monthly contributions to a savings account.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> At the conclusion of the program, all funds in the savings account were available to the client. Other guidelines included a prohibition of the abuser on the property. Individuals not named on the lease were not allowed to reside in the unit.</p>
  <p>Site A additionally operated an emergency shelter for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Site A has provided transitional housing for over 10 years. This provider also concurrently operated permanent supportive clustered housing that accepted subsidies from the federal government’s housing choice voucher program (Section 8) administered through the county housing authority. Three units were reserved to provide transitional housing to individuals in this population with an undocumented immigration status.</p>
  <h3 id="site-b">Site B</h3>
  <p>Site B was a domestic violence service provider that that had been providing transitional housing services to this population for more than 18 years. The provider operated a transitional housing program for victims in a mostly rural area serving seven counties in central Illinois. The program employed a scattered site housing model, providing 10 units of transitional housing, with eight being occupied at the time of the staff interviews (July 2018). Five of the units were part of one apartment complex and the other five were spread across the community.</p>
  <p>The intake process for transitional housing clients involved an in-person meeting with a case manager to gather information on client demographics, service needs, safety concerns, and potential barriers. To be eligible, an individual must have been homeless as a result of domestic violence. The program paid the full amount of clients’ rent for up to two years.</p>
  <p>Program guidelines mainly included safety measures, such as not allowing the abuser or any violent individuals on the property. The program also asked that participants not disclose to anyone that their unit is a transitional housing residence. Clients were required only to attend a monthly tenant meeting and participate in in-home case management sessions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
  <p>The housing units were rented under the program’s name and clients were rotated through the same residences over the grant period. To protect confidentiality, clients signed an occupancy agreement with the program in lieu of signing a lease. The occupancy agreement outlined the terms of the lease as well as the program requirements. Landlords who worked with this program also signed a confidentiality agreement and were not given the name of the client living in the residence. If clients were interested in remaining in the unit upon program completion, program staff worked with the landlord to allow clients to take over the leases in their own names.</p>
  <p>In addition to providing transitional housing, Program Site B also operated an emergency shelter with a 45-day maximum stay. The program received additional funding for transitional housing from the U.S. Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) and applied Illinois Department of Human Services funding to the matching requirement.</p>
  <h3 id="site-c">Site C</h3>
  <p>Program Site C was a domestic violence service provider that had been providing transitional housing services in Cook County for more than 15 years. The program operated 15 units of transitional housing at the time of the staff interviews (September 2018). The organization owned a building with four units that was used in part for transitional housing clients. Other units followed the clustered site model and were in a large apartment complex in an affordable area of the community. Clients could participate in the program for up to two years, with the possibility of a six-month extension. Clients had the option of assuming their leases and continuing to reside in the units upon program completion. Clients that relocated to a certain part of Cook County after the program were eligible to apply for assistance with a security deposit and first month’s rent.</p>
  <p>After an individual filled out an application for transitional housing, they underwent an intake process involving a self-reported assessment of their current situation and discussion of their goals and objectives. To be eligible, participants had to be over 18 years old and a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Accepted participants were required to sign a confidentiality agreement; visitors to the program-owned property also were required to sign confidentiality agreements. Additional program rules included prohibiting abusers on the property and smoking was not allowed in the residences. Participants were required to engage in case management services at least once per month.</p>
  <p>Clients who lived in the privately-owned apartment complex were required to submit to a criminal background check conducted by the property management company. Individuals with past criminal convictions were still eligible to be housed in the agency-owned building. For clients residing in privately-owned units, the program acted as the leaseholder and the clients were listed as occupants. This allowed the program to simply update the names of the occupants on the lease as clients moved in and out. Clients residing in the agency-owned building signed a program occupancy agreement in lieu of a lease. Clients in the agency-owned building paid 30 percent of their monthly income to the organization as a program fee.</p>
  <p>The program operated a 45-day emergency shelter, as well as an interim shelter program for individuals who exceeded a 45-day stay but were still in need of shelter services due to housing barriers. Individuals on the waiting list for transitional housing were eligible for the interim shelter program. The organization also received funding from OVW for transitional housing. The organization was interested in pursuing opportunities to acquire additional agency-owned properties to potentially be used for permanent supportive housing for this population.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Research suggests domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness and housing instability for women and children in the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Housing uncertainty can additionally contribute to re-victimization, especially if forced to seek alternative shelter in risky or unstable situations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Victims may choose to stay in an abusive relationship because they have no other housing options.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> Victims may find themselves with limited employment prospects and income potential often due to abusers not allowing them to find gainful employment or sabotaging them in the workplace.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> Abusers also commonly isolate their victims from family or friends, limiting the support network needed to seek a temporary place to stay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Victims of human trafficking face many of the same challenges as domestic violence victims and can benefit from similar services in some instances.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shelter and housing services were reported as two of the most critical needs of individuals seeking domestic violence services in Illinois.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> To address those needs, transitional housing programs pay a portion of housing costs for victims, allowing them to leave emergency shelters and safely move into more permanent residences. Best practices suggest that clients pay no more than 30 percent of their income for rent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> Many transitional housing programs also offer participants counseling, employment assistance, and other support services based on clients’ individual needs.</p>
<p>Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) researchers conducted a process evaluation to examine the implementation of three transitional housing program models in Illinois. This evaluation offers implications for policy and practice to improve programming and serves as a guide for future funding considerations.</p>
<p>Researchers sought to answer the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What are the programs’ policies and procedures?</li>
    <li>How do programs employing different models operate differently?</li>
    <li>What are the characteristics of the clients?</li>
    <li>To what extent are clients satisfied with the program?</li>
    <li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the programs?</li>
    <li>What barriers exist to program implementation as intended?</li>
    <li>To what extent do programs provide services beyond housing and/or coordinate with partner organizations to offer services beyond housing?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
<p>Findings of a nationwide survey of transitional housing programs revealed several descriptive characteristics of their program models.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<ul>
    <li>Forty percent of programs were in urban areas, 23 percent were in suburban areas, and 37 percent were in rural areas.</li>
    <li>Seventy-three percent of programs had maximum lengths of stay between one and two years.</li>
    <li>Approximately half of the programs surveyed had fewer than nine units.</li>
    <li>Programs had been operating for an average of nine years.</li>
    <li>Respondents reported nearly two-thirds of program funding was received through state and federal sources.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical research is somewhat limited on the effectiveness of transitional housing programs for victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking. One study found high levels of housing instability were significantly associated with reduced quality of life, greater reporting of symptoms of PTSD and depression, and more absences from work or school.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> Another study found those who received permanent supportive housing subsidies were less likely to report experiencing intimate partner violence than comparison groups; families with higher levels of psychosocial need that received transitional housing were also less likely to report intimate partner violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Transitional housing programs offer stable housing, which can prevent or mitigate some adverse consequences that result from housing instability due to domestic violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> One study found transitional housing can provide greater support than other housing options for individuals and families with high levels of need. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup> Research has found transitional housing programming was most successful when services were tailored to individual needs and providers were able to provide ongoing support after a client secured housing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="current-study">Current Study</h2>
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<p>Evaluators examined three transitional housing programs in Illinois that received funds from the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) administered by ICJIA. The sites offered a range of programs with varying characteristics for the process evaluation (<em>Table 1</em>). Programs are referred to as Sites A, B, and C for anonymity. The <em>Appendix</em> tab provides more detailed descriptions of each program site. The evaluation was conducted between April 2018 and April 2019, with data collected between June 2018 and January 2019. Research methods included analysis of administrative program data and interviews with program staff and clients. The evaluation methods were approved by ICJIA’s Institutional Review Board.</p>

<h3 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h3>
<h4 id="interviews-with-program-clients">Interviews with program clients</h4>
<p>Researchers interviewed current and former clients of three transitional housing programs in Illinois. Program staff at Sites A and C provided researchers contact information for clients who were willing to be contacted by phone to participate in an interview. Staff at Site B requested clients be given the option to contact research staff if they wished to take part in an interview.</p>
<p>Eight clients from Site A and 14 clients from Site C consented to be contacted for interviews. Four clients from Site A were interviewed, one scheduled an interview but did not answer or return phone calls at the scheduled time, one did not wish to schedule an interview, one never answered or returned voicemails left by researchers, and one had a number that was disconnected. Seven clients from Site C were interviewed, one scheduled an interview but did not answer or return phone calls at the scheduled time, and six never answered or returned voicemails left by researchers. Two clients from Site B contacted researchers and were interviewed.</p>
<p>Researchers conducted client interviews in person (1) and via telephone (12). Verbal or written consent was obtained from all participants prior to the start of the interviews. All interviews were conducted by the primary investigator and audio-recorded. Interviews lasted between 30 and 71 minutes. Participants received a $20 Walgreen’s gift card as compensation for their time. The consent form and interview questions were translated into Spanish and a Spanish-speaking researcher was available to conduct an interview if a research subject stated that preference; however, no interviewees expressed a preference to conduct the interview in Spanish. The interview schedule included 46 questions focusing on client experiences with the program (26), satisfaction with staff and services (6), and demographic information (14). <em>Table 2</em> provides demographic information about the sample of clients interviewed. A three-year retrospective housing history was also conducted to gather information on participants’ prior housing arrangements. Fifteen questions were adapted from prior evaluations of programming for victims of domestic violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Research staff transcribed the recorded interviews. The transcripts were analyzed using qualitative analysis software QSR NVivo 9. Two research analysts individually coded an initial sample of transcribed interviews and then collaborated to create a coding scheme for the entire sample employing a negotiated agreement process that improves inter-coder reliability for in-depth semi-structured interviews.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> Researchers used the codes to analyze the entire sample of interviews and added new codes as necessary.</p>

<h4 id="interviews-with-program-staff">Interviews with program staff</h4>
<p>Staff from three program sites were interviewed in person and via telephone.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> A total of 11 staff members were interviewed, including five individuals from Site A and three from each of Sites B and C (<em>Table 3</em>). Each program identified individuals who worked closely with the transitional housing programs to take part in the interviews. Their job titles included transitional housing specialist, case manager, and CEO, among others. Interviewees had a great deal of experience, reporting an average of over eight years of work at their respective organizations. The interviews ranged from 44 to 83 minutes in length. All interviews were conducted by the primary investigator and each participant provided written or verbal consent prior to the interview. Program staff interviews were audio-recorded.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Interview questions for program staff were developed by researchers to elicit their views on the program’s successes and challenges (21 questions), the needs of the target population in addition to housing (6 questions), their experiences with the administration of the grant (9 questions), and demographics (11 questions). Staff also provided a more comprehensive overview of program operations in the interviews. Nine questions were adapted from prior transitional housing program evaluations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> Researchers used the same coding process for staff interviews as the process described above for client interviews.</p>

<h4 id="administrative-program-data">Administrative program data</h4>
<p>Researchers collected administrative data from InfoNet, a web-based, centralized statewide case management system used by state-funded domestic and sexual violence service providers in Illinois. Over 100 participating service provider organizations employ InfoNet to collect and report information about clients and services, 67 of which specifically serve domestic violence victims.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> The three transitional housing programs in this evaluation utilized InfoNet and permitted researchers to extract record-level, de-identified data on transitional housing clients’ demographics, needs, and services received during a portion of the grant period. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS.</p>
<h3 id="study-limitations">Study Limitations</h3>
<p>The study was limited by the inability to examine all transitional housing programs receiving VOCA funds. Researchers included only three programs in the study due to resource limitations at the evaluating agency; thus, the present findings may not be indicative of all transitional housing programs.</p>
<p>InfoNet has some limitations as a data collection system, such as closed-ended questions that limit response choices; data were extracted from this system at a single point in time for this evaluation, so the information is only a snapshot of client characteristics.</p>
<p>Relying largely on qualitative interview data was a limitation due to the potential for misinterpretation, bias, an imbalance of power between the interviewer and subject, limited subject recall, among other challenges.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Further, researchers were not able to speak to all transitional housing clients; clients that were willing to participate may be different from those who chose not to participate or could not be contacted (i.e., self-selection bias). Finally, feedback from some stakeholder groups (e.g., landlords, clients’ children) was not collected as part of this process evaluation. These issues limit the generalizability of the findings of this process evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="study-findings">Study Findings</h2>
<h3 id="program-goals">Program goals</h3>
<p>Transitional housing programs aimed to provide victims with a safe, stable residence away from their abuser. By providing safe and stable housing, transitional housing gave clients space for healing while allowing them to define personal goals and address other challenges in their life. Programs aimed to provide participants with the tools and resources they needed to be independent and empowered when they left transitional housing.</p>
<h3 id="supportive-services">Supportive services</h3>
<p>In addition to financial assistance for housing, the programs provided an array of supportive services to their clients. Staff of all three programs reported the goal of wrap-around services was to help clients address additional needs and barriers during their time in the program. All services were voluntary and clients guided the creation of their service plan to address their individual needs and goals. As domestic violence service providers, these three programs also served clients who were not part of the transitional housing program (e.g., emergency shelter clients, walk-in clients); many supportive services were open to all clients of the provider organization, such as counseling services and legal advocacy.</p>
<p>According to analyses of administrative data, transitional housing clients at the three sites received an average of 169 hours of program services over an 18-month period. <em>Figure 1</em> shows the number of service hours provided to transitional housing clients in the most common service categories.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> Program sites differed in the areas in which they provided the most service hours; Sites A and B provided the greatest number of service hours in life skills programming and children’s group counseling, whereas Site C provided more in-person and adult group counseling. These four categories accounted for 62 percent of all service hours provided to transitional housing clients during the period studied.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="program-successes">Program Successes</h3>
<p>According to the research interviews, success looked different for each client based on their unique goals. Program staff as well as clients spoke highly of the work being done through transitional housing and provided many examples of successes that resulted from participation in the program.</p>
<h4 id="stable-housing">Stable housing</h4>
<p>Through the program, clients received safe and stable housing during the program period. Staff reported many clients successfully secured permanent housing by the end of the transition period. Staff members said participation in the program helped clients improve credit scores, make debt payments, build a recent rental history, and obtain landlord references to expand housing options once program participation ended.</p>
<h4 id="advocacy-with-landlords">Advocacy with landlords</h4>
<p>During the interviews, program staff said developing relationships with landlords was critical to the success of transitional housing programs. Staff at all three organizations recounted instances where landlords were hesitant to work with a third-party or with a domestic violence service provider. However, program staff reported that after their advocacy on behalf of the programs and clients, the landlords who agreed to participate were highly satisfied.</p>
<h4 id="relationships">Relationships</h4>
<p>Participants noted that case managers were great resources for help with myriad tasks and issues and provided unwavering emotional support to clients. Staff explained that positive client relationships allowed case managers to better understand and address the needs of the population they served. In the interviews, four clients and eight staff members reported the transitional housing programs fostered community and support among participants.</p>
<h3 id="program-challenges">Program Challenges</h3>
<p>Transitional housing programs face many challenges. Some are inherent to the model, while others may vary between communities.</p>
<h4 id="high-demand">High demand</h4>
<p>Staff interviews revealed the three organizations maintained waiting lists for their transitional housing programs. Staff and clients described how waiting lists can be problematic, particularly for this population, because many applicants were facing homelessness or living in unstable environments, i.e., illicit drug use, crowded, noisy.</p>
<h4 id="access-to-services">Access to services</h4>
<p>Some clients reported barriers to accessing services through the program or through external referrals. Three clients also mentioned discrepancies between what they felt like was available to others in the program versus what was available for them, suggesting barriers to communication regarding available services. An issue that came up several times during the interviews was clients’ challenge of continually asking for services on an as-needed basis; three clients reported feeling discouraged or burdensome when asking for the same service repeatedly.</p>
<h4 id="property-maintenance">Property maintenance</h4>
<p>Many clients reported they were very satisfied with the quality of the apartments and shared examples of maintenance issues that were successfully resolved. However, six clients cited challenges with building maintenance and/or the property management staff. Some clients expressed concerns about damage to the units from prior tenants, issues with the quality of unit-specific furnishings (e.g., appliances, carpet), as well as delays in the required processes to have maintenance address issues at the properties.</p>
<h4 id="grant-administration-and-funding">Grant administration and funding</h4>
<p>The most common challenges reported involved funding restrictions on certain types of assistance, such as food assistance, furnishings, application fees, and security deposits. One staff member reported aiming to keep staffing costs to a minimum to allocate as much funding for rental assistance as possible; however, this had the effect of placing a high burden on case management staff.</p>
<h4 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h4>
<p>Staff members from all three programs reported their transitional housing programs would not be sustainable without grant funds. Because rental assistance required such high proportions of capital investment, few options were identified by staff for their organizations to raise or otherwise acquire the funds necessary to cover a meaningful portion of participants’ rental expenses. Balancing the timing of clients moving in and out with projected funding cycles posed a challenge for some of the programs.</p>
<h2 id="implications-for-policy-and-practice">Implications for Policy and Practice</h2>
<p>The following are implications based on the study findings. These are suggestions to enhance programming and may require additional resources to implement.</p>
<h3 id="educate-on-tenant-rights-and-responsibilities">Educate on Tenant Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Many clients said learning about their rights and responsibilities as a tenant was a valuable aspect of the program. Programs could consider formalizing this information and creating a curriculum or workshop for participants. Clients in this population may face discrimination from landlords, therefore education about what to expect during the leasing process and what to expect from their relationships with landlords/property management could be beneficial.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Some of the challenges identified by program participants and staff stemmed from poor communication or other issues with the property management staff; allowing clients to be more informed about the expectations of all parties may help to resolve or mitigate some of these challenges.</p>
<p>Information on rights and responsibilities is important for clients as they prepare to exit the program and either look for permanent housing or assume the lease of their transitional housing residence. Additionally, many clients discussed their goal to eventually buy a home. One study in the Netherlands found that of residents who formerly lived in publicly subsidized housing, those who became homeowners scored higher on measures of housing-related empowerment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> Including information about home ownership and the mortgage process could help program participants to pursue this goal and make informed choices between renting and owning property.</p>
<h3 id="expand-and-engage-other-victim-types">Expand and Engage Other Victim Types</h3>
<p>This evaluation was limited as no clients were identified as victims of human trafficking. Research suggests that human trafficking victims have many of the same needs as domestic violence victims.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> It would be beneficial for programs to examine their outreach efforts and determine whether there is an unmet need for services for human trafficking victims in the population they serve. Research suggests few providers have the resources to perform direct outreach services, but for those that can engage in outreach activities—consistency, trust, commitment, and involvement of survivors are noted as key principles of success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>Victims who experience immigration status-related barriers (e.g., limited opportunities for employment) are also likely to benefit from transitional housing programs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> One of the sites examined here reserved three residences specifically for victims with an undocumented immigration status, yet a staff member acknowledged more units were needed to serve this population. Transitional housing programs for victims of all types should consider the needs of this subpopulation in their communities and explore removing barriers that exclude individuals with an undocumented immigration status (e.g., employment requirements). Victims of all types of crime often belong to communities that can benefit from programs that expand access to safe and affordable housing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="address-funding-restrictions">Address Funding Restrictions</h3>
<p>In the research interviews, staff commonly reported uncertainty or limitations around what was allowable under federal VOCA funding guidelines. Most transitional housing programs across the country are funded with multiple sources, which was also true of the three programs that participated in this evaluation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup> While multiple funding sources offer some flexibility due to varying requirements, this can also pose difficulties for program administrators to reconcile allowable costs, such as food assistance, transportation, and childcare. Extant research has highlighted the importance of access to flexible funding that can assist clients in overcoming barriers that are not directly related to housing but are still important for restoring stability (e.g., car repairs, childcare costs).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> Grant administrators and program staff should engage in a dialogue to examine needs that are unmet due to funding restrictions and explore potential opportunities to implement a portion of funding with greater flexibility. Further, public-private partnerships could be explored to allow programs to more comprehensively meet the needs of victims.</p>
<h3 id="enhance-stakeholder-and-public-awareness-and-education">Enhance Stakeholder and Public Awareness and Education</h3>
<p>Staff and clients noted in the interviews that some communities displayed a limited awareness of the issue of domestic violence, as well as a lack of information about victim needs. A lack of awareness around the problem can limit access to victim services, hinder investigations and prosecutions, and impede a community’s ability to secure funding to combat the issue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Efforts by organizations to increase awareness and educate law enforcement, healthcare professionals, and others on issues such as how to identify domestic violence victims and appropriate responses to victimization can benefit all victims, even those who never seek direct services from service providers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p>
<p>Evaluators noted a dearth of research and data on housing needs specific to human trafficking victims. While some programs intended to serve human trafficking victims, limited administrative and program data were available at the time of the evaluation on if and how their needs and/or outcomes differed from those who were victims of domestic violence. Continued training for program staff and other stakeholders (e.g., law enforcement) conducted by multi-disciplinary teams can help to bolster collaboration and improve service delivery to this client population.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> Additional research is needed to compare the housing trajectories and program experiences of those who experienced different types of victimization.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, the findings of this evaluation demonstrated that these transitional housing programs provided a vital service to individuals who were victims of domestic violence. Nearly all program clients expressed satisfaction with the programs and staff reiterated a high level of perceived program success. Transitional housing programs are not intended to replace emergency shelters, but to expand the housing options available to victims. Extant research, supported by these evaluation findings, suggests that transitional housing is most successful when clients are given the agency to make choices in their own best interest (e.g., what services to pursue, whether to remain in their residences, how much (if any) contact to have with the abuser.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> Further, the findings of this evaluation were in accord with the conclusions of prior research that hold program clients should be treated as experts of their own situations and programs should avoid exerting unnecessary control.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p>
