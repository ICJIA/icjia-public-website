teaser: Research has found nearly all prisoners have experienced a traumatic event in their life and a high proportion suffer from PTSD. Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority and WestCare Foundation (Illinois) researchers surveyed 573 Illinois prisoners to understand the trauma they experienced and explore the relationship between trauma and substance misuse. Researchers found 89 percent of those surveyed had both experienced and witnessed more than one traumatic event during their lifetime. Almost one-fourth of the sample were identified as being symptomatic for PTSD (24 percent). In addition, researchers found a relationship found between greater PTSD symptoms and higher drug use. This article describes survey findings and provides implications for police and practice in correctional facilities.

<p>Research indicates traumatic event exposure is a near universal experience among prisoners.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="See footnote" class="footnote">1</a>  Research also suggests exposure to traumatic events is related to future criminal activity.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="See footnote" class="footnote">2</a>  Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) researchers collaborated with the WestCare Foundation (Illinois) to survey men housed in Illinois correctional facilities to explore the impact of traumatic life events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Through the survey, researchers sought to understand trauma experienced by those incarcerated and its intersection with substance misuse.</p>

<p>Most Americans experience a traumatic event in their lives, and a small percentage develop PTSD.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="See footnote" class="footnote">3</a>  The proportion of individuals experiencing trauma and PTSD symptoms is higher among incarcerated individuals. Prior ICJIA studies found <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/assets/pdf/ResearchReports/PTSD_Female_Prisoners_Report_1110.pdf">60 percent of women prisoners</a> and <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/probable-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-a-sample-of-urban-jail-detainees">20 percent of male jail detainees</a> were PTSD symptomatic and almost all individuals in both samples had experienced a traumatic life event.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="See footnote" class="footnote">4</a>  These findings were consistent with other research indicating that frequent trauma exposure and PTSD severity are risk factors for criminal justice involvement.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="See footnote" class="footnote">5</a>  Increased PTSD symptom severity, for instance, is associated with increased adjustment problems, such as interpersonal hostility, substance abuse, and violent behavior,<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="See footnote" class="footnote">6</a>  conduct that increases the likelihood of criminal justice contact. </p>

<p>Along with high exposure to trauma and PTSD, research indicates that substance use disorders are highly prevalent among incarcerated persons.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="See footnote" class="footnote">7</a>  Research estimates as many as 75 percent of individuals who are incarcerated have substance use disorders.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="See footnote" class="footnote">8</a>   Prisoners with substance use disorders are more likely to have experienced physical and sexual abuse, parental substance misuse, parental incarceration, and homelessness compared to prisoners without substance use disorders.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="See footnote" class="footnote">9</a>  Moreover, substance use disorders and PTSD commonly co-occur among samples of incarcerated people.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="See footnote" class="footnote">10</a>  </p>

<p>Individuals suffering from a substance use disorder and PTSD are at an elevated risk of cycling in and out of the criminal justice system.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="See footnote" class="footnote">11</a>  Research shows incarcerated men who have substance use disorders and PTSD have higher recidivism rates than those with only substance use disorders.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="See footnote" class="footnote">12</a>  Similarly, the likelihood of relapse is higher among incarcerated women with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders than those who only have substance use disorders.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="See footnote" class="footnote">13</a> </p>



<h2 id="current-study"><strong>Current Study</strong></h2>

<p>The purpose of this study was to understand trauma experienced by those incarcerated and its intersection with substance misuse. To learn about this issue, Authority researchers administered a paper survey to men incarcerated in April 2016 in two Illinois correctional facilities: Sheridan Correctional Center and the Adult Transition Center-Crossroads. All individuals surveyed were participating in substance abuse treatment with <a href="https://www.westcare.com/">WestCare Foundation (Illinois)</a>. Traumatic life events and PTSD symptoms were cataloged using questions from the Life Events Checklist (LEC) and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C).<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="See footnote" class="footnote">14</a>  Individuals also were asked questions regarding prescription and synthetic drug use.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="See footnote" class="footnote">15</a>  </p>

<p>The sample totaled 573 individuals.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="See footnote" class="footnote">16</a>  Among them, 25 percent were White, 48 percent were Black, and 11 percent were Hispanic (16 percent unknown). The average age among the sample was 35 years old, with a median age of 33 years. On average, individuals in the sample had 16 total prior arrests, with an average of six prior property arrests, five prior drug arrests, and three prior violent arrests. There was a median of 14 prior arrests, with a median of four prior property crimes, four prior drug arrests, and two prior violent arrests.</p>

<p>In addition to survey data, researchers examined the sample’s data collected by WestCare clinicians that included their demographics and <a href="http://www.tresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ASI_5th_Ed.pdf">Addiction Severity Index (ASI) assessments</a>. The ASI was completed during one-on-one interviews with WestCare clinicians to create a diagnostic impression of client’s severity of substance use, potential issues during treatment and life areas impacted by substance use. These other areas include: health, employment, legal, family/social, and psychiatric. Authority researchers also matched survey participants to their criminal history information using the Illinois State Police, Criminal History Record Information database. The study was approved by the Authority’s Institutional Review Board, its oversight body for all research involving human subjects. </p>

<p>The PTSD Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) is a standardized, self-reporting tool. It consists of 17 questions using a Likert scale rating how much an individual has been bothered by certain concerns/issues in the last month (1= not at all, 5= extremely), resulting in a severity score ranging from 17 to 85. For the purpose of this report, a conservative cut-off score of 50 was used to classify individuals as having probable PTSD, using DSM-IV symptom criteria (<em>Table 1</em>).<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="See footnote" class="footnote">17</a>  The term “probable” is used because only clinicians, not researchers, are able to make diagnoses.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

<p>All research studies have limitations and this study was no exception. First, individuals surveyed may have had difficulty recalling traumatic events prior to incarceration. Second, participants may have been hesitant to provide truthful information because they were surveyed while residing in prison. Although participants were informed of their rights as research subjects, including their rights to confidentiality, some participants may still have had concerns over disclosing past illegal drug behaviors. Third, the sample obtained was a convenience sample of individuals at two correctional facilities enrolled in substance abuse treatment with the WestCare Foundation (Illinois); therefore, the findings are not generalizable to other populations, even those residing in other Illinois Department of Corrections facilities.</p>



<h2 id="main-findings"><strong>Main Findings</strong></h2>



<h3 id="trauma-experiences-and-ptsd-scores-of-all-respondents">Trauma Experiences and PTSD Scores of All Respondents</h3>

<p>Researchers used a conservative cutoff score of 50 or more on the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) to identify respondents as having probable PTSD. Using this criteria, 136 respondents, or 24 percent, were identified as having probable PTSD. </p>



<h4 id="trauma-events"><strong>Trauma events</strong></h4>

<p>Eighty-nine percent of those surveyed had both experienced and witnessed more than one traumatic event during their lifetime. Ninety percent of all respondents indicated that they had experienced at least one traumatic event and 64 percent indicated they had witnessed at least one traumatic event. </p>



<h4 id="ptsd-symptoms"><strong>PTSD symptoms</strong></h4>

<p>Of all respondents: </p>

<ul>
<li>56 percent experienced symptoms for Criterion B; they experienced recurring and persistent re-experiences of traumatic event.</li>
<li>39 percent experienced symptoms for Criterion C; they avoided certain thoughts, feelings, activities, places, or people; experienced difficulty recalling aspects of their trauma.</li>
<li>46 percent experienced symptoms for Criterion D; they experienced difficulty sleeping or concentrating, irritability or anger, and hypervigilance.</li>
</ul>

<p>A total symptom severity score ranges from 17 to 85 and is the sum the scores in each of the 17 items from 1= (Not at all) to 5 (Extremely). The average PTSD severity score of all respondents was 36.98, with a median score of 33 and a most frequently reported score of 17.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="See footnote" class="footnote">18</a>  <em>Figure 1</em> offers a box-whisker plot, which graphically displays the high and low ends of the distribution of PTSD severity scores (using horizontal brackets).</p>

<h3 id="trauma-experiences-and-symptoms-of-respondents-having-probable-ptsd">Trauma Experiences and Symptoms of Respondents Having Probable PTSD</h3>



<h4 id="traumatic-events"><strong>Traumatic events</strong></h4>

<p>Nearly all of the 136 respondents with probable PTSD had <em>experienced and/or witnessed</em> more than one traumatic event during their lifetime (97 percent) with an average of 10 events being experienced and/or witnessed. Ninety-six percent indicated that they had <em>personally experienced</em> (not witnessed) at least one traumatic event from the Life Events Checklist with an average of seven events experienced. Seventy-three percent indicated they had witnessed at least one traumatic event, with an average of three events witnessed. </p>



<h4 id="ptsd-symptoms-1"><strong>PTSD symptoms</strong></h4>

<p>Of those having probable PTSD (n=136):</p>

<ul>
<li>54 percent had all five symptoms of Criterion B; they experienced <br>
recurring and persistent re-experiences of a traumatic event.</li>
<li>75 percent five to seven symptoms of Criterion C; they avoided <br>
certain thoughts, feelings, activities, places, or people, or <br>
experienced difficulty recalling aspects of their trauma.</li>
<li>42 percent experienced all five symptoms of Criterion D; they <br>
experienced difficulty sleeping or concentrating, irritability or <br>
anger, and hypervigilance.</li>
</ul>

<p>More than half of those having probable PTSD reported experiencing 13 of the 17 problems or complaints from the PTSD Checklist–Civilian version. Of those in the sample who reported being bothered <em>quite a bit or extremely</em> by symptoms within the previous 30 days, 70 percent reported experiencing the symptoms of repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts or images of a stressful experience from the past and being “super alert” or watchful or on guard. Less than half reported having trouble remembering important parts of a stressful experience, being emotionally numb or unable to have loving feelings, acting or feeling as if a stressful experience were happening again, or feeling jumpy or easily startled (<em>Figure 2</em>). </p>

<h3 id="substance-use-of-respondents-having-probable-ptsd"><strong>Substance Use of Respondents Having Probable PTSD</strong></h3>

<p>The sample was in in-prison, substance use disorder treatment at the time they were surveyed, so the data found co-morbidity of those in the sample with probable PTSD. Twenty-three percent reported daily alcohol problems and 42 percent reported daily drug problems within the 30 days prior to incarceration. Sixty-three percent of those having probable PTSD reported using prescription drugs during their lifetimes to get high or alter their states of mind. </p>

<p>The ASI alcohol severity scores indicated that, on average, those who were identified as having probable PTSD had a <em>moderate</em> problem with drugs and a <em>slight</em> to <em>moderate</em> problem with alcohol.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="See footnote" class="footnote">19</a>   Nearly half of the respondents with probable PTSD reported a <em>considerable</em> to <em>extreme</em> problem with drugs (48 percent) and 31 percent had a <em>considerable</em> to <em>extreme</em> problem with alcohol (Figure 3).</p>

<h3 id="differences-among-those-with-and-without-probable-ptsd"><strong>Differences Among Those With and Without Probable PTSD</strong></h3>

<p>Demographics of those having probable PTSD were similar to those without PTSD including race, age, and prior arrests. Researchers found a relationship between race and probable PTSD—a greater proportion of non-Whites identified as probable PTSD compared to Whites.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="See footnote" class="footnote">20</a>  Researchers found individuals identified with probable PTSD experienced a higher number of traumatic events.<a href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21" title="See footnote" class="footnote">21</a> </p>

<p>Respondents reporting more PTSD symptoms also reported more drug use.<a href="#fn:22" id="fnref:22" title="See footnote" class="footnote">22</a>  Higher PTSD severity was associated with reporting a higher number of days experiencing a drug problem (in the 30 days prior to incarceration); individual ASI scores indicate an average of 10 days experiencing a drug problem prior to incarceration, with a median of 0 days, and a range between 0 days (n=293) and 30 days (n=154). These scores were most frequent at 0 and 30 days.<a href="#fn:23" id="fnref:23" title="See footnote" class="footnote">23</a>  Researchers found a greater proportion of those identified with probable PTSD previously used prescription drugs and/or synthetic marijuana.<a href="#fn:24" id="fnref:24" title="See footnote" class="footnote">24</a>  The survey focused on prescription drugs and synthetic marijuana, so association with other drug use was unknown. </p>



<h2 id="implications-for-policy-and-practice"><strong>Implications for Policy and Practice</strong></h2>

<p>This research found that those in the sample of prisoners experienced a traumatic event and a high number of those individuals are PTSD symptomatic, which is consistent with previous studies. As seen in other studies, the data indicated that more traumatic events were associated with an increased number of PTSD symptoms. This research found a slight relationship between PTSD and substance use. A higher proportion of those identified as PTSD probable used drugs prior to incarceration. The data also revealed that a higher proportion of non-White respondents reported having probable PTSD than White respondents. The following are implications based on this research and the literature on trauma and PTSD of prisoners.</p>



<h3 id="consider-comorbidity">Consider Comorbidity</h3>

<p>Anxiety disorders, like PTSD, and substance use disorders are among the most common mental health conditions.<a href="#fn:25" id="fnref:25" title="See footnote" class="footnote">25</a>  This study found a relationship between probable PTSD and drug use—respondents who previously users were more likely to report symptoms indicative of a PTSD diagnosis. In addition, a correlation was noted between PTSD severity score and number of days experiencing a drug problem in the 30 days prior to incarceration. This supports research that has shown PTSD and substance use disorders to be comorbid and that substance use is commonly employed to cope with trauma.<a href="#fn:26" id="fnref:26" title="See footnote" class="footnote">26</a>  Research has found comorbidity to be associated with greater symptom severity, greater functional impairment, and poorer outcomes than for either disorder alone.<a href="#fn:27" id="fnref:27" title="See footnote" class="footnote">27</a>  Prisoners receiving substance use disorder treatment might also benefit from treatment for PTSD.</p>



<h3 id="minimize-re-traumatization-in-correctional-settings">Minimize Re-Traumatization in Correctional Settings</h3>

<p>Corrections personnel can avoid exacerbating PTSD symptoms suffered by individuals within the prison population by minimizing procedures that may inadvertently re-traumatize them. Policies, practices, and procedures found in prison settings, such as strip searches/pat downs, loud noises/voices, doors slamming, and segregation may trigger PTSD symptoms. Prison staff may work to minimize re-traumatization and address trauma in the prison population by screening and treating PTSD within the environment. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/nctic">trauma-informed correctional settings</a> include:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Do no harm” approach.</li>
<li>Minimization of re-traumatization.</li>
<li>Highly structured, predictable, consistent limits.</li>
<li>Staff training to include techniques in responding to trauma/trauma symptoms.<a href="#fn:28" id="fnref:28" title="See footnote" class="footnote">28</a> </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="apply-trauma-informed-practices-and-evidence-based-trauma-programming">Apply Trauma-Informed Practices and Evidence-Based Trauma Programming</h3>

<p>Research suggests that patients diagnosed with PTSD and related disorders experience considerable symptom reductions when evidence-based practices (EBP) are implemented in routine care settings.<a href="#fn:29" id="fnref:29" title="See footnote" class="footnote">29</a>  The need for implementation of EBPs for treating PTSD cuts across a variety of service agencies.<a href="#fn:30" id="fnref:30" title="See footnote" class="footnote">30</a>  Individual or group cognitive behavioral therapy and adherence to an integrated treatment model in cases of co-occurring substance abuse and PTSD have been identified as best practices for treating PTSD.<a href="#fn:31" id="fnref:31" title="See footnote" class="footnote">31</a>  In addition to clinical behavioral therapy, EBPs that can be used in correctional settings include <a href="http://www.seekingsafety.org/">Seeking Safety</a> and <a href="http://www.advancedtrauma.com/index.html">Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Treatment (TARGET)</a>. Seeking Safety is designed to treat those with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders. TARGET uses a seven-step process to help trauma survivors gain control of PTSD reactions and understand how trauma changes brain responses.<a href="#fn:32" id="fnref:32" title="See footnote" class="footnote">32</a>  More research is needed to better understand how trauma treatment outside of the prison environment might be adapted to meet the needs of people who are incarcerated. </p>
