teaser: Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM) is a federally-funded research program that collects information on drug use from juvenile and adult arrestees booked into detention or jail. Data collected by the program showed 75 percent of adult male arrestees in a Chicago sample tested positive for illicit drugs in 2013, which is more than the 60 percent collectively testing positive in 10 other ADAM programs across the country. The majority of Chicago arrestees tested positive for marijuana (56 percent), while 18 percent tested positive for cocaine, 14 percent tested positive for opiates, and less than 1 percent tested positive for methamphetamine.

<p>Research has clearly and consistently documented the connection between drug use and criminal offending. Individuals who use illegal drugs are more likely to commit crimes while they are under the influence.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="See footnote" class="footnote">1</a>  Nearly 75 percent of the 2.3 million prison inmates in the United States meet criteria for substance abuse or addiction.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="See footnote" class="footnote">2</a>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/arrestee-drug-abuse-monitoring-program">Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM)</a> is a federally-funded research program that collects information on drug use from juvenile and adult arrestees booked into detention or jail. Data collected by the program showed 75 percent of adult male arrestees in a Chicago sample tested positive for illicit drugs in 2013, which is more than the 60 percent collectively testing positive in 10 other ADAM programs across the country.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="See footnote" class="footnote">3</a>  The majority of Chicago arrestees tested positive for marijuana (56 percent), while 18 percent tested positive for cocaine, 14 percent tested positive for opiates, and less than 1 percent tested positive for methamphetamine.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="See footnote" class="footnote">4</a>
</p>
<p>Statistics show that most offenders who commit drug offenses are also drug users. According to 2013 ADAM data, nearly 90 percent of Chicago offenders arrested for drug possession offenses and 84 percent arrested for drug distribution offenses tested positive for at least one drug. As ADAM data indicates, it is likely that a high percentage of those entering state prisons for drug law violations have previous drug use histories. According to the Illinois Department of Corrections, 9,237 inmates, or 19 percent of the prison population, were incarcerated for violations of the Controlled Substance Act or the Cannabis Control Act in 2014.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="See footnote" class="footnote">5</a>  Another 7,782 Illinois parolees, or 28 percent of the total 2014 parolee population, were on parole for violations of those Acts (<em>Figure 1</em>).<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="See footnote" class="footnote">6</a>

<h2 id="treatment-programs-for-offenders">Treatment programs for offenders</h2>
<p>Treatment plays a critical role in reducing offender drug abuse and criminal recidivism. Research shows offenders who participate in community-based drug treatment programs commit fewer crimes than those who do not participate. The largest benefit of treatment is found in reduced victimization and costs of incarceration.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="See footnote" class="footnote">7</a>
</p>
<h3 id="community-based-treatment-drug-courts">Community-based treatment: Drug courts</h3>
<p>More than <a href="http://www.illinoiscenterofexcellence.org/data/printer-friendly-courts.cfm">60 drug courts in Illinois</a> aim to divert low-level offenders with substance abuse disorders from a prison term by allowing them to participate in community-based treatment. Teams of probation officers, treatment providers, prosecutors, law enforcement, defense attorneys, and judges monitor offender participation. Most Illinois drug courts require offenders to plead guilty and waive their rights to a trial, but once the offender successfully meets drug court requirements, including regular and frequent drug testing, their charges may be dismissed. The judge may impose a traditional sentence if the requirements are not met. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have concluded that <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/assets/articles/Fidelity%20to%20Drug%20Court%20ARI%20FINAL%2012-8-15.pdf">drug court programs</a> reduce recidivism and are cost effective. <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="See footnote" class="footnote">8</a>
</p>
<h3 id="prison-based-treatment">Prison-based treatment</h3>
<p>In state fiscal year 2014, 45 percent of the 28,612 inmates screened for substance abuse were deemed in need of treatment upon entry into the Illinois Department of Corrections. <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/cjreform2015/pdf/IDOC%20Power%20Point%20Presentation%20%284%20%2024%2015%29copy2.pdf">Of the 12,940 inmates in need of treatment services, just 6,500, or 50 percent, received them</a>.
</p>
<p>Illinois is not the only state lacking inmate substance abuse treatment options. A survey of state and federal prisoners showed while half met criteria for drug abuse or dependence, fewer than 20 percent received treatment.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="See footnote" class="footnote">9</a>  Only 15 percent of state and 17 percent of federal prisoners reported having received drug treatment since admission.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="See footnote" class="footnote">10</a>
</p>
<p>Obstacles to treatment continue for substance dependent offenders upon their release from prison. Offenders re-entering the community typically experience high rates of unemployment resulting in a lack of health insurance, presenting another barrier to treatment.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="See footnote" class="footnote">11</a>  A study of drug users in New York cited lack of insurance or Medicaid as one of the main reasons for not enrolling in substance abuse treatment.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="See footnote" class="footnote">12</a>  Other barriers included scheduling difficulties and long waiting periods for treatment availability<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="See footnote" class="footnote">13</a>.
</p>
<p>It is critical for criminal offenders to receive treatment to reduce both drug abuse and criminal recidivism. <a href="http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=32300">Up to 75 percent of parolees in Illinois who leave prison without drug treatment for their addictions resume drug use within three months of release</a>, and research has shown an offender's risk of dying from a drug overdose is 129 times greater in the two weeks following release from prison than for the general public.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="See footnote" class="footnote">14</a>
</p>
<p>The Sheridan Correctional Center operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections provides evidence-based substance abuse treatment and rehabilitative services to adult male inmates. Inmates receive intensive, prison-based, drug treatment along with vocational training, job preparation, mental health services, and a highly supervised and supportive reentry program. In 2014, 2,043 offenders were incarcerated and receiving treatment at Sheridan. <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/assets/pdf/ProgEvalSummary/Program_Eval_Sheridan_Year6_072011.pdf">A 2011 study of Sheridan prison graduates</a> found a three-year recidivism rate of 43 percent, lower than the 50 percent recidivism rate of a comparison group. Graduates who continued to receive services after returning home had a 32 percent recidivism rate.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="See footnote" class="footnote">15</a>
</p>
<p>The Southwestern Illinois Correctional Center (SWICC) Meth Prison and Reentry Program is a 200-bed dedicated methamphetamine addiction recovery program. Inmates undergo highly intensive methamphetamine treatment and participate in a community reentry program to combat addiction and reduce recidivism. Inmates receive vocational training, job preparation, mental health services, and continued treatment as they transition back into the community. A 2011 study showed inmates who successfully completed reentry aftercare had a 48 percent lower likelihood of recidivating than a comparison group.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="See footnote" class="footnote">16</a>
</p>
<h3 id="funding-limitations">Funding limitations</h3>
<p>Drug treatment programs have become less accessible due to funding limitations at local, state, and federal levels. Illinois experienced a dramatic decrease in available treatment programs between 2007 and 2012, with Illinois ranking at the bottom--44th out of 46 states for state-funded treatment capacity in 2012.<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="See footnote" class="footnote">17</a>  State funding for addiction treatment decreased 24 percent from 2007 to 2015 (<em>Figure 2</em>). These cuts particularly impact those in low socio-economic areas, including many in the criminal justice system, who rely on state-funded treatment centers for help.

<h2 id="implications-for-policy-and-practice">Implications for policy and practice</h2>
<p><strong>Drug court programs should be maintained and, where possible, expanded in Illinois as an effective alternative to incarceration.</strong> Drug courts are evidence-based, proven to reduce recidivism and save taxpayer money.<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="See footnote" class="footnote">18</a>  Drug courts offer offenders the opportunity to remain in their communities while accessing needed treatment and services and prevent longer-term consequences associated with a felony drug conviction.
</p>
<p><strong>Intensive in-prison treatment with aftercare planning, such as that used at Sheridan, should be expanded.</strong> Prison-based substance abuse treatment programs that include aftercare components are proven best practices in curbing offender drug abuse and recidivism. Sheridan prison graduates who completed or were still enrolled in aftercare showed the lowest recidivism rates of the three comparison groups--inmates with similar characteristics and backgrounds released from other Illinois prisons during the same time period; inmates who were removed or dropped out of the Sheridan program; and Sheridan graduates who did not complete aftercare.<a href="#fn:19" id="fnref:19" title="See footnote" class="footnote">19</a>   This finding is consistent with other research; one study of a California prison showed that 75 percent of those not involved in the treatment program returned to prison while only 27 percent of prisoners who received treatment and aftercare post-release were re-incarcerated.<a href="#fn:20" id="fnref:20" title="See footnote" class="footnote">20</a>
</p>
<p><strong>More data and research are needed on the drug-addicted offender population in Illinois.</strong> Few resources are available detailing the problem of substance abuse within the criminal justice population. Additional data, such as the number of substance-dependent arrestees, probationers, and inmates, would assist in development of more targeted and cost-effective solutions.
</p>
<p><strong>All substance-abuse treatment should be evaluated for effectiveness.</strong> Scarce state resources should be devoted to evidence-based programming. Programs serving offending populations should be evaluated to determine whether the programming offered reduces substance use as well as reoffending.  Funding for programs or practices not proven to reduce substance use or reoffending should be discontinued.
