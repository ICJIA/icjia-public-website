<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The relationship between victimization and offending, also referred to as the victim-offender overlap, is widely documented.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Most victims of crime do not become offenders, but most offenders
    have been victims.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Although the exact number of victim-offenders (offenders that have experienced victimization) is unknown, victimization is highly prevalent within the general population.
    The 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) revealed U.S. residents experienced 5.4 million violent victimizations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> Children are at higher risk for victimization; 61 percent
    of U.S. youth under age 17 were exposed to violence in the past year, and 39 percent of children and their caregivers reported multiple direct victimizations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> A 2017 <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/victim-needs-assessment">ICJIA study</a>    found 55 percent of individuals in Illinois had been victimized in their lifetimes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<div align="center"><br>ONE OF THE STRONGEST<br> 
  EMPIRICAL ASSOCIATIONS IN CRIMINOLOGICAL LITERATURE IS<br> 
  BETWEEN 
  OFFENDING<br /> 
  AND VICTIMIZATION. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>
  <p></p></div>
</div>


<p>Although victims of crime can experience non-violent events, such as a burglary or theft, this article mainly focuses on exposure to violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> Exposure to violence can include direct interpersonal
    victimization, threatened physical harm, or the witnessing or hearing about violence. The victimization experience can produce negative physical, mental, and behavioral outcomes in individuals and some may go on to commit crime.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>    This article focuses on victimization that precedes offending; however, it is recognized that conversely, offending may lead to victimization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> By examining the phenomenon of victim-offender
    overlap, practitioners can learn ways to address prior victimization to reduce offending and recidivism. This report outlines leading theoretical explanations for the victim-offender overlap, factors that influence victimization and offending, and
    recommendations for practitioners to address violent victimization and prevent subsequent offending.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-some-victims-become-offenders">Why Do Some Victims Become Offenders?</h2>
<p>Scholars do not agree on why some victims are at risk for becoming offenders. The issue is complex and varies by individual demographics, victimization types, and crimes committed.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-framework">Theoretical Framework</h3>
<p>Several theories attempt to explain the relationship between victimization and later offending. All theories feature the themes that offending is learned through victimization experiences and victimization along with offending is experienced by the same
    groups and individuals. Theories include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The intergenerational transmission of violence theory.</strong> Also referred to as the social learning theory of aggression, the intergenerational transmission of violence theory posits that violent behavior is passed down through generations
        via social learning or a cycle of violence. Violence is observed to be an effective problem-solving technique employed when other options have not been positively reinforced.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>
    <li><strong>Routine activities/lifestyle perspective theory.</strong> The routine activities/lifestyle perspective theory proposes that a lack of supervision combined with relationships with deviant peers allows or supports individuals to commit violence.
        The same variables put the individuals at high risk for victimization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> The <strong>social disorganization theory</strong> similarly suggests the environment and peer group membership
        lead to victimization which influences offending.</li>
    <li><strong>Strain theory.</strong> Strain theory suggests offending is a coping response to exposure to violence or “strain.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> Similar theories include <strong>social control theory</strong>, which posits
        that people learn offending behavior from their own victimization experiences,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> and <strong>self-control theory</strong>, which proposes individuals ignore the potential negative
        consequences of their actions leading to criminality and victimization.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Research has tested some victim-offender overlap theories and confirmed risk factors for victim-offenders:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Impaired decision-making.</strong> In a study of youth, prior victimization influenced decision-making in situations that resulted in violent offending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup></li>
    <li><strong>Common characteristics and behaviors.</strong> College students who were victims of assault and their offenders had similarities—were more likely to be male with similar lifestyle behaviors, such as arrest in last six months and buying or
        selling illegal drugs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup></li>
    <li><strong>Learned from experiences.</strong> A meta-analysis by Stith and colleagues revealed a relationship between growing up in an abusive family and later involvement in a violent marriage. Victims learned violence from their victimization experiences
        which influenced their perpetration of violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="factors-that-influence-victimization-and-the-perpetration-of-violence">Factors that Influence Victimization and the Perpetration of Violence</h2>
<p>The social-ecological model is a theoretical framework that examines the complex relationship between societal, community, relationships, and individual factors that put people at risk for victimization and/or perpetration of violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>    Each factor encompasses unique experiences with violence while acknowledging their effect on one another (<em>Figure 1</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> It is theorized that by addressing these factors, victimization
    can be reduced and, therefore, subsequent offending by victims can be averted or reduced.</p>

<h3 id="individual-level-factors">Individual-Level Factors</h3>
<p>Individual-level factors that contribute to violence include age, education level, income, and mental health indicators.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> Violent behavior stems from individuals’ psychosocial development,
    biology (i.e., neurology, hormones, genetics), and social processes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Most youth follow a predictable pattern of risk-taking with new environmental milestones (such as progression
    through school), as they are introduced to new stimuli. Mental health indicators, including substance use disorders, also are related to offending and effective treatment of these conditions have been linked to reduced recidivism.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>    Childhood maltreatment has been linked to an overactive stress response and long-term changes in brain structures that are involved in emotion regulation and aggression.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="trauma-and-posttraumatic-stress">Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress</h4>
<p>Although more research is needed, trauma appears to contribute to offending and violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> Trauma can be caused by victimization, as well as other life events, such as unexpected loss
    of a loved one and natural disasters. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health diagnosis based on traumatic events resulting in symptoms that are persistent and intrusive and causing psychological distress and changes in cognitions,
    mood, arousal, and reactivity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> PTSD and trauma history have been found to be strongly associated with criminal justice involvement and high rates of psychiatric illness have been
    found among criminal justice populations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup> In three Illinois-based ICJIA studies, 61 percent of women in prison, 24 percent of men in prison, and 21 percent of men jail detainees
    met criteria for PTSD.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> Extant research indicates trauma creates a risk of violent victimization through direct ways, such as social learning, and/or indirect ways, such as substance
    misuse and mental health issues.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Individuals may react differently to the same traumatic experience, expressing varying levels of fear, anger, guilt, shame, and sadness. Effective intervention strategies should reflect this understanding.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="relationship-level-factors">Relationship-Level Factors</h4>

<div class="callout right style1 style3">

  OF MANY ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup><p></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Negative relationships with peers and family, as well as direct victimization or observation of violent behavior, can influence violent behavior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> Children’s behavior is shaped largely
    by caregivers and siblings, but in school-age years, peers gain influence. Victimization through bullying at school is a strong risk factor for later offending.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> There is some research
    support that school-age children who experience victimization want to protect themselves by appearing strong and choose violent behaviors.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="adverse-childhood-experiences">Adverse Childhood Experiences</h4>
<p>Victimization in adolescence is a stronger predictor of offending than in other life stages.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> Youth are vulnerable to different types of victimization at different ages. For example,
    experiencing sibling violence decreases with age, but experiencing weapon offenses increase with age. For some children who experience many victimizations, there are spikes in violent victimization prior to age seven and age 15 which roughly are periods
    of school transition—entry into elementary and high school.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/capt/practicing-effective-prevention/prevention-behavioral-health/adverse-childhood-experiences">Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)</a> are stressful or traumatic events (<em>Figure 2</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>    A 2014 study indicated an estimated 32 percent of Illinois youth had experienced one or two ACEs and 9 percent had experienced three or more.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup> ACEs are associated with juvenile delinquency,
    <sup

        are associated with earlier and higher likelihood of arrest.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup> Research also shows a relationship between the number of ACEs involving violence and the risk of future intimate
        partner violence.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup></p>

<br>

<h4 id="community-level-factors">Community-Level Factors</h4>
<p>Community-level factors can encourage or limit violence and can include neighborhood characteristics, such as unemployment rates, population density, and ease of transportation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup> Residents
    may feel disconnected from the justice system and prioritize other groups that make them feel secure, such as gangs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup> Experiencing or witnessing violence in the community, such as
    hearing gunshots or reports of danger nearby, can affect one’s sense of safety and motivate violent behavior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> Some youth in disadvantaged neighborhoods begin offending behavior early
    and persist over time, in part related to supervisory neglect and limited economic opportunities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="societal-level-factors">Societal-Level Factors</h4>
<p>Societal-level factors that have a relationship with violence include the rules that govern the society, enforcement structures/organizations, and the society’s broad cultural norms. For example, cultural norms surrounding gender and conflict resolution
    may lead to males believing their and their families’ safety are directly related to their ability to physically dominate others and fiercely retaliate against slights to honor or pride.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-implications-for-policy-and-practice">Conclusion and Implications for Policy and Practice</h2>
<p>Victimization is, unfortunately, all too common in our society creating harm to individuals who, for complex and varied reasons, may then go on to commit criminal and even violent offenses. However, most individuals who experience violent or traumatic
    events do not commit acts of violence in the future.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup> Although a link between the two phenomena-victimization and offending-has been established, the specifics of the link are still
    not clear. Violence prevention strategies can be enhanced with research on victim-offender overlap not just in individuals, but in larger societal groups and longitudinally.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup> In addition,
    the criminal justice system should consider strategies to address issues related to justice-involved individuals’ past trauma and victimization.</p>

<h3 id="prevention-strategies-to-reduce-victimization-and-future-offending">Prevention Strategies to Reduce Victimization and Future Offending</h3>
<p>Individual-level violence prevention strategies include therapy, education, and skills training. Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows individuals the connection between their experiences, attitudes, and behaviors, and anger management and aids in development
    of healthy coping skills and effective self-expression.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup> Relationship-level strategies to offset negative influences of peers and family include parenting classes and family therapy,
    in which caregivers learn about positive/negative reinforcement, conflict resolution, and modeling, and mentoring programs, which offer victims examples of healthy relationships. In addition, effective anti-bullying programs in schools prevent future
    offending and such programs feature a good cost-benefit ratio.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Community-level activities require significant investment, but also offer the opportunity to more dramatically affect crime and injury rates. Improved school resources, increased opportunities for employment, and safe spaces for recreation are some of
    the pillars of collective efficacy needed for communities to self-regulate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup> Societal-level strategies that improve large-scale systems, such as education and economics, are challenging
    to tackle. However, criminal justice policies and practices can affect violence at a societal level. Individuals’ trauma and the traumatic effects of victimization can be acknowledged at each <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/criminal-juvenile-justice/samhsas-efforts">sequential intercept</a>    of the criminal justice system. The system can also employ <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/trauma-informed-and-evidence-based-practices-and-programs-to-address-trauma-in-correctional-settings">trauma-informed care and use evidence-based programs</a>.
    <sup
        class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup> While removal from a negative community environment may be a practical response to reduce threats of violence, justice-involved individuals often return to their communities with the same criminogenic issues.
        By employing evidence-based programs and practices and offering trauma-informed care to victim-offenders, the criminal justice system can both end individual cycles of violence and contribute to community violence prevention.</p>
