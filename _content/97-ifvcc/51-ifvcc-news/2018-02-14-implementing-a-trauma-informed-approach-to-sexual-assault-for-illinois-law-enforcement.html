  <p><strong>Event Date: March 8,  2018</strong></p>
  <p>The Sexual  Assault Incident Procedure Act addresses troubling statistics that show only a  fraction of sexual assault victims report crimes to law enforcement  authorities. The law was passed to encourage more sexual assault victims to  come forward and increase the successful prosecution of sexual assault crimes  throughout the state. The trauma of sexual assault and sexual abuse often leads  to severe mental, physical, and economic consequences for the victim. A  victim’s ability to recover from the trauma of sexual assault or sexual abuse  has been directly linked to the response of others to their trauma,  particularly the response of law enforcement authorities to a victim who comes  forward to report the crime. This presentation will explore the neurobiology of  trauma and the effect trauma has on the brain and memory. It will help explain  why being trauma informed is crucial when interviewing victims of all violent  crimes, including sexual assault.
