Vickie Smith is executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Ms. Smith began her work in the battered women’s movement in 1982 by providing emergency safe housing to survivors of domestic violence. She helped open a non-residential crisis intervention program, first serving on its Board of Directors and then serving as the first non-paid director. She joined ICADV in 1988 as a grant monitor and became executive director in 1993. Ms. Smith is a founding Board member of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, a national advocacy agency located in Washington D.C. During the development of the National Network, she worked with other state and national advocates on drafting the historic 1994 Violence Against Women Act. Her wide-ranging experience has allowed her to build a variety of collaborative projects and programs over the decades to work toward ending violence in homes and communities. Ms. Smith has a bachelor’s degree in child, family and community services from Sangamon State University, now known as the University of Illinois at Springfield.  <u1:p></u1:p>
