Anne holds an MA in Sociology and Women’s Studies from Colorado State University and a PhD in Criminology, Law, and Justice from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Before coming to ICJIA, she completed a postdoctoral research appointment at Rutgers University’s Center on Violence Against Women and Children. Prior to completing her PhD, she worked for several years at a rape crisis center, overseeing community-based prevention education and outreach and working as an advocate. This experience informs her approach to research partnerships and study design. Her published research focuses on understanding the recovery outcomes of survivors of interpersonal violence and finding the best responses across the social ecology. Anne’s mixed-methods dissertation assessed the effects of the Illinois budget impasse on rape crisis centers throughout the state and how service delivery was impacted, as well as the effects on organizations, staff, and clients.
