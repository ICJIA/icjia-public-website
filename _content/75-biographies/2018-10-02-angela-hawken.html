Angela Hawken, Ph.D., is a Professor of Public Policy at the NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management and director of the Litmus program. She is the founder and director of BetaGov, a resource center for practitioner-led trials that provides tools to develop and conduct experimental tests of practices and policies in order to increase the pace of innovation in criminal-justice and other policy areas. She is also the founder and director of Segregation Solutions, which supports stakeholder-led innovation and research in reducing the use of solitary confinement. Additionally, she is the principal investigator of several studies that test “Swift Certain Fair” (SCF) strategies to reduce recidivism and incarceration; she led the advisory teams to the Washington State Department of Corrections (WADOC) in its statewide rollout of Swift and Certain and to the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) in its RESET parole-reform effort. She works with agencies in 14 states that are implementing and evaluating SCF in community corrections and in custody. Dr. Hawken completed a bachelor’s degree, an honors degree, and graduate coursework in economics at the University of the Witwatersrand, as well as a Ph.D. in policy analysis at the RAND Graduate School.
