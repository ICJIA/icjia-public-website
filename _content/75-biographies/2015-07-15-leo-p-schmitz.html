Leo P. Schmitz was appointed director of the Illinois State Police in February 2015. Mr. Schmitz’s law enforcement career spans nearly 30 years, dating back to 1986, when he joined Chicago Police Department (CPD) as a police officer. He was later promoted to work on the Joint Robbery Task Force, a cooperative effort between CPD and the University of Illinois Police Department where he and his partners made over 500 robbery arrests. After being shot twice in 1996 in pursuit of a robbery suspect, whom he also apprehended, Mr. Schmitz was presented with the Illinois Law Enforcement Medal of Honor by then-Gov. James Edgar, the Chicago Superintendent's Award of Valor, and the Blue Star Award by the Chicago Police Department. Mr. Schmitz quickly rose through the ranks of the CPD and has received numerous awards for his service. In 2009, he was selected to lead CPD’s Gang Enforcement Unit, which centralized all 50 district gang teams. His unit was recognized for its success with a Meritorious Citation. In January 2012, Mr. Schmitz was assigned to lead Chicago’s Englewood District. The district saw a 44-percent drop in homicide his first year and a 14 percent reduction in shootings. In December of 2012, he was promoted to deputy chief, a role in which he served until his CPD retirement in January 2015.
