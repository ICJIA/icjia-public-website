Jennifer Hiselman manages ICJIA’s InfoNet System, a web based data collection and reporting system used by over 100 victim service providers statewide. She joined ICJIA in 1996 as a researcher with focus areas in victimization, victim services, domestic violence and sexual assault. She worked closely with ICJIA’s Federal and State Grants Unit assessing Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grantees’ performance, developing data collection tools and supporting victim services strategic planning. She lead an evaluation of Illinois’ Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) programs and the state’s first crime victimization survey of citizens. Jennifer has served as ICJIA’s InfoNet manager since 2005. In addition to continuing research in her focus areas, she oversees the operation of InfoNet, manages project budgets, provides training and technical assistance, hosts user forums to identify new data collection needs, and works closely with victim service providers and other stakeholders using InfoNet’s data for strategic planning. Outside of ICJIA, Jennifer volunteers for a domestic violence service provider in her community.
