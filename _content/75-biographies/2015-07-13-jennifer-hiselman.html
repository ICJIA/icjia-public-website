<p>Jennifer Hiselman manages ICJIA’s InfoNet System, a web-based data collection and reporting system used by over 100 victim service providers statewide. Jennifer joined ICJIA in 1996 as a researcher focusing on victimization, victim services, and interpersonal violence. She worked closely with ICJIA’s Federal & State Grants Unit to inform victim services planning, lead an evaluation of Illinois’ Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) programs, and managed the state’s first crime victimization survey. As InfoNet Manager, Jennifer oversees InfoNet’s operation, provides training and assistance to users, hosts user forums to identify new data collection needs, and works with various stakeholders using InfoNet’s data for strategic planning. Most recently, Jennifer led efforts to rebuild InfoNet on a new technology platform for increased performance, utility, and sustainability. InfoNet 2.0 was deployed in April 2018. Outside of ICJIA, Jennifer volunteers for a domestic violence service provider in her community. <br></p>
