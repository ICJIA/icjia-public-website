2003, representing Illinois’ 20th Legislative District. Ms. Martinez was the first
Latina elected to the State Senate in Illinois history. She again made history
in 2007 as the first Latina assistant majority leader, a role she assumed again
in 2018. As a state senator, Ms. Martinez used her position to advocate for
affordable housing, expanding health care access, and ensuring seniors and the
disabled populations receive proper care. </p>

the Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus, including previously serving as a
Co-Chair, gave her a platform to work on initiatives of importance to
minorities. She championed a law allowing people who a not comfortable speaking
or understanding English, as well as those who have trouble hearing, to be
aided by an interpreter in the court room. Another law she spearheaded ensured
that all health care facilities treating Medicaid patients in managed care
plans must develop and implement language services. </p>
