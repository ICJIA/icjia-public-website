Caleb Schaffner joined ICJIA’s Center for Victim Studies in May 2020 as an InfoNet research analyst. His work centers around improving victim service providers’ use of InfoNet as both a case management tool and as a resource for understanding trends, service outputs, and outcomes. Prior to joining ICJIA, Caleb taught sociology at three colleges around the Chicagoland area. Caleb holds a doctoral degree and master’s degree in sociology with a concentration in race, ethnicity, and gender from the University of Illinois at Chicago and a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Northern Illinois University. While his dissertation looked at differences in experiences leaving religion, he has a variety of research interests in the social sciences.&lt;
