<p>Justin earned his BA in psychology with a minor in criminal justice from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, and his MA and PhD in criminology, law, & justice from the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is typically drawn to research related to policing, psychology, policy, youth/community development, and technology. His past research collaborations include a community survey about surveillance cameras on CTA trains, an evaluation of police body-worn camera implementation, two national surveys of police officers, and several community surveys about face-to-face police interactions. Justinâ€™s dissertation explored the work of police officers through the lenses of community policing, emotional labor, and procedural justice and tested the relationships between officer emotional intelligence, officer attitudes and community ratings of officer demeanor.</p>
