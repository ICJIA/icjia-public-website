of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Prior to his appointment, Mr. Smith
served as the executive vice president of foster care and intact services at
Aunt Martha’s Health & Wellness, Illinois’ largest provider of services to
families in crisis, since 2009. In the role, he collaborated with child welfare
leaders, professionals and other stakeholders to implement family-centered
systems and practices that protected and supported vulnerable children and
families. Prior to serving with Aunt Martha’s, Mr. Smith worked for more than
two decades as a social worker, trainer and leader in child welfare. From 2004
to 2009, he served as a program administrator and recovery coach at Treatment
Alternatives for Safe Communities, where he managed the child welfare division.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Smith worked as a public service administrator for
DCFS from 1993 to 2000. Mr. Smith has served on numerous boards, committees and
work groups, helping to shape policies and inform best practices in leadership
and in the field. He has also led the development of program models that have
increased the likelihood of family reunification, increased adoptions and
significantly improved the ability of workers and agencies to connect people
with substance abuse treatment, mental health care and other supportive
services. A licensed clinical social worker and certified trainer, Mr. Smith
received his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Illinois State
University and his master’s degree in social work from the University of
