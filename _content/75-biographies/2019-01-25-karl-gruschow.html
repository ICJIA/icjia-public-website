Karl Gruschow joined ICJIA as a research analyst for InfoNet in January 2019. He is charged with supporting and growing the InfoNet system while conducting research with InfoNet data. Prior to joining ICJIA, Karl worked as a data consultant and project manager in human service software implementation. He also was involved in launching a new online database and reporting system for California’s prison reentry program, building an HMIS system for Philadelphia, Pa., and other reporting and system design projects for regional nonprofits and county governments. Karl’s research projects include developing an agent-based model of retributive violence in cultures of honor, several studies on how framing of ethnic and national identity affects empathy (e.g. victim blaming), and an ethnographic investigation of long-term volunteers’ motivations.
