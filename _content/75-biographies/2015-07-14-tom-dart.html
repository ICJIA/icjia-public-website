Tom Dart was sworn in as the 52nd Cook County sheriff in December 2006. Mr. Dart began his career in public service as an assistant state's attorney in Cook County. In 1992, Mr. Dart won a seat in the Illinois House, where he sponsored Mayor Daley's Safe Neighborhoods Act and authored several state laws designed to crack down on child sex offenders, including a statute that targeted child predators that use the Internet to lure young victims. Mr. Dart also wrote the Sexually Violent Predators Commitment Act, enabling judges to detain sexual predators in state mental health facilities if they believe the offender is likely to commit new sex crimes. Mr. Dart joined the Cook County Sheriff's Office in 2003, where he served as chief of staff to former Cook County Sheriff Michael F. Sheahan.
