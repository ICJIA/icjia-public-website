Jackie Gilbreath is a Research Analyst in ICJIA’s Center for
Justice Research and Evaluation. Jackie applies a values- and action-oriented
approach to her work with research that amplifies social justice. Prior to
joining ICJIA, Jackie was a court research analyst with the National Center for
State Courts, where she conducted research that resulted in improving state
court operations in the areas of violence against women, mental health in the
courts, pretrial justice, court responses in probate courts, access to justice,
and race and ethnicity data. Jackie also completed professional internships
with the Federal Public Defender’s Office in the Eastern District of Missouri;
Justine Peterson, a credit-building agency in St. Louis; and Sojourner Family
Peace Center in Milwaukee as a victim advocate. Her research interests include
mental and behavioral health, domestic violence, and justice policies that
reduce disparities for historically marginalized populations. Jackie received a
bachelor’s degree in sociology and social welfare and justice from Marquette
University and a master’s degree in social work from Washington University in St.
Louis, with a concentration in social and economic development and a
specialization in policy.
