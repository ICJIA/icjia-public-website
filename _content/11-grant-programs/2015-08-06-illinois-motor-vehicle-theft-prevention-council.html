With the support of the insurance industry, the General
Assembly established the Illinois Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Council in
1991 to combat vehicle theft, insurance fraud, and related crimes. The
Council’s responsibilities, as listed in the Illinois Motor Vehicle Theft
Prevention Act, include assessing the scope of motor vehicle theft, particularly
in those areas of the state with the highest theft rates, allocating funds made
available for the purpose of the act, and developing and implementing
strategies to combat motor vehicle theft. The Act requires that certain
insurance companies pay into a special trust fund in the state treasury $1 for
each vehicle insured the previous year. Grants are made from this fund to
support special auto theft task forces and investigative teams, prosecutions,
statewide audits of salvage yards, public education, officer training, and data
analysis. <o:p></o:p>
