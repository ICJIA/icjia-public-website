summary: '<p>The basic premise underlying the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program is that both offender-focused and system-focused activities must hold the offender accountable and address the fact that three parties are affected by juvenile crime, the offender, the victim and society. For the juvenile offender, accountability means an assurance of facing individualized consequences through which he or she is made aware of, and held responsible for the loss, damage, or injury perpetrated on a victim. Strengthening the juvenile justice system requires an increased capacity to develop youth competence, to efficiently track juveniles through the system, and to provide enhanced options such as restitution, community service, victim-offender mediation, and other restorative justice sanctions that reinforce the mutual obligations of an accountability-based juvenile justice system. </p>'

<p>The basic premise underlying the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program is that both offender-focused and system-focused activities must hold the offender accountable and address the fact that three parties are affected by juvenile crime, the offender, the victim and society. For the juvenile offender, accountability means an assurance of facing individualized consequences through which he or she is made aware of, and held responsible for the loss, damage, or injury perpetrated on a victim. Strengthening the juvenile justice system requires an increased capacity to develop youth competence, to efficiently track juveniles through the system, and to provide enhanced options such as restitution, community service, victim-offender mediation, and other restorative justice sanctions that reinforce the mutual obligations of an accountability-based juvenile justice system.
</p>
<p>JABG funds must be spent in one or more of the following 17 purpose areas:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Developing, implementing, and administering graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders.</li>
	<li>Building, expanding, renovating, or operating temporary or permanent juvenile correction, detention, or community corrections facilities.</li>
	<li>Hiring juvenile court judges, probation officers, and court-appointed defenders and special advocates, and funding pretrial services (including mental health screening and assessment) for juvenile offenders, to promote the effective and expeditious administration of the juvenile justice system.	</li>
	<li>Hiring additional prosecutors, so that more cases involving violent juvenile offenders can be prosecuted and backlogs reduced.</li>
	<li>Providing funding to enable prosecutors to address drug, gang, and youth violence problems more effectively and for technology, equipment, and training to assist prosecutors in identifying and expediting the prosecution of violent juvenile offenders.	</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining training programs for law enforcement and other court personnel with respect to preventing and controlling juvenile crime.	</li>
	<li>The establishment of juvenile gun courts for the prosecution and adjudication of juvenile firearms offenders.</li>
	<li>The establishment of drug court programs for juvenile offenders that provide continuing judicial supervision over juvenile offenders with substance abuse problems and the integrated administration of other sanctions and services for such offenders.</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining a system of juvenile records designed to promote public safety.	</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining interagency information-sharing programs that enable the juvenile and criminal justice systems, schools, and social services agencies to make more informed decisions regarding the early identification, control, supervision, and treatment of juveniles who repeatedly commit serious delinquent or criminal acts.	</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining accountability-based programs designed to reduce recidivism among juveniles who are referred by law enforcement personnel or agencies.</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining programs to conduct risk and need assessments of juvenile offenders that facilitate the effective early intervention and the provision of comprehensive services, including mental health screening and treatment and substance abuse testing and treatment to such offenders.</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining accountability-based programs that are designed to enhance school safety.</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining restorative justice programs.</li>
	<li>Establishing and maintaining programs to enable juvenile courts and juvenile probation officers to be more effective and efficient in holding juvenile offenders accountable and reducing recidivism.</li>
	<li>Hiring detention and corrections personnel, and establishing and maintaining training programs for such personnel to improve facility practices and programming.</li>
	<li>Establishing, improving and coordinating pre-release and post-release systems and programs to facilitate the successful re-entry of juvenile offenders from state and local custody in the community.</li>
</ul>

	Illinois' award is based on a formula. The formula provides a minimum allocation of 0.5 percent of the available funds to each state, with the remaining funds allocated to each eligible State based on relative share of the aggregate of all states' population of people under the age of 18. States must allocate 75 percent of the total JABG award to eligible units of local government.
