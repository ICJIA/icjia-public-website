The National Instant Criminal Background Check System
Reporting Improvement Program provides assistance to states to improve the
completeness, automation, and transmittal of records to state and federal
systems used to conduct background checks. Such records include criminal
history records, records of felony convictions, warrants, records of protective
orders, convictions for misdemeanors involving domestic violence and stalking,
records of mental health adjudications, and others that may disqualify an
individual from possessing or receiving a firearm under federal law. Helping
states to automate these records also reduces delays for law-abiding gun purchasers.
