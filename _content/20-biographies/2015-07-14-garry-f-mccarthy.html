<p>Garry F. McCarthy was named Chicago Police Department Superintendent in June 2011. In this role, Superintendent McCarthy employs crime fighting and prevention strategies that reduced violence and crime under his leadership in New York City, N.Y., and Newark, N.J. Superintendent McCarthy began his career in law enforcement with the New York Police Department (NYPD) in 1981, and steadily rose through the ranks. He was named NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations in 2000 and served as the principal crime strategist for the department. Under his leadership, NYPD saw a significant decline in homicides. That steady decline culminated in 2005 with its lowest murder rate since 1963.</p>
<p>Superintendent McCarthy demonstrated strong leadership as a supervisor while commanding three separate precincts during a five-year period and bringing about significant positive changes. His success ultimately led him to a new assignment at the 70th precinct, where he helped diminish a double digit crime rate as well as decrease the number of complaints against police officers. These accomplishments garnered the praise of the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office. In the fall of 2006, Superintendent McCarthy was chosen to lead the Newark Police Department, which achieved a 9 percent reduction in murder within his first year. Along with this reduction, the Newark Police Department experienced additional improvements in efficiency and professionalism, including a 17 percent increase in arrests and diminished complaints against police officers.</p>
