Domestic violence and sexual assault are serious problems in Illinois. While many such offenses are reported yearly, localities often lack resources needed to make arrests, to prosecute effectively, to convict, and to provide needed victim services. The federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) provides financial assistance to states for developing and strengthening law enforcement, prosecution, and victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women. As the state agency charged with administering the Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors (STOP) VAWA award in Illinois, nearly $5 million in FFY10 from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) is responsible for developing a plan to distribute these funds. ICJIA has used this funding stream since 2004, in part, to fund four Illinois counties  McLean, Peoria, St. Clair and Kankakee  to operate multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) that are designed to better coordinate local services. McLean, Peoria and St. Clair counties address domestic violence (DV), and Kankakee County addresses the problem of sexual assault (SA). The purpose of this study is to describe and assess these four MDTs.
