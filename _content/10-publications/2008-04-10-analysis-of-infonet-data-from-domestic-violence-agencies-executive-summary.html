This summary highlights the findings from analysis of domestic violence service data obtained by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) through its InfoNet system between the period of January 1, 1998 and December 11, 2005. The data were provided by nearly 70 domestic violence centers throughout Illinois that receive funding from either the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) or the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS). We briefly discuss the methodology and research questions and then summarize the findings from the analysis of data as it pertains to each of the questions. Recommendations related to the findings are also presented.
