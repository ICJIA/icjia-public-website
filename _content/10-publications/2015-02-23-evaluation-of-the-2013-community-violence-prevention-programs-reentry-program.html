In 2013, the Reentry Program, one of three components of the state of Illinois Community Violence Prevention Program (CVPP), provided services to youth and young adults on parole in 12 Chicago communities to help them transition back to their communities and reduce recidivism. ICJIA researchers conducted an exploratory study though interviews with the programs case managers to learn how the program operated and make recommendations to change and enhance the program.
