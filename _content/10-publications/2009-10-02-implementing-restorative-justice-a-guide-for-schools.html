This publication is one in a series of guides designed to assist in the statewide promotion of balanced and restorative justice. BARJ is a philosophy of justice that can guide the work of individuals who deal with juvenile offenders, their victims, and the communities in which they live.

The goals of this guide are to promote compliance among those working in juvenile justice in Illinois with the state's policy on BARJ outlined in the Juvenile Court Act; improve the response to juvenile conflict and crime by increasing the knowledge and understanding of BARJ by juvenile justice professionals, agencies, communities and their members; and, offer strategies, programs, and practices that incorporate the values and principles of BARJ.
