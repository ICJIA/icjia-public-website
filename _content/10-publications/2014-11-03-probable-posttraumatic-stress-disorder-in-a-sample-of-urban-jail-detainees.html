Jails in the United States house large numbers of detainees who have urgent public and behavioral healthcare needs as well as various serious social, economic, and personal problems. Jails are often the primary (or only) settings for medical, psychiatric, and substance abuse treatment (McDonnell et al., in press). These settings provide unparalleled opportunities for studying and treating some of the most troubled and troublesome concentrations of people in the country (Watson, Hanrahan, Luchins, and Lurigio, 2001).
