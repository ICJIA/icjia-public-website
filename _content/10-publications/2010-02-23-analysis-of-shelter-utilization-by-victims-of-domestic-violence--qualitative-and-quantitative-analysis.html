The Analysis of Shelter Utilization by Victims of Domestic Violence project was funded by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in the spring of 2008 to address two primary issues: 1) The shelter and service utilization patterns and outcomes and housing needs of women who are domestic violence victims, and 2) the stages in the process by which they make changes in their situation. Toward this end, this project relied on a variety of data sources, including multiple interviews with women in shelter programs in Chicago, data from the City of Chicago's Domestic Violence Help Line and data from ICJIA's InfoNet system. Both quantitative data and qualitative analyses were conducted using data from these sources. This report contains the findings from these analyses.
