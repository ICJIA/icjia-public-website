This report presents detailed information about reported crime on four-year college campuses in Illinois using data collected by colleges as mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, and submitted to the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Post-Secondary Education. Reported crime data from 37 four-year colleges (25 private and 12 public) in Illinois with enrollments of 2,500 or more are presented for the period of 2005 through 2008. Results were also compared to trends in two other sources of Illinois campus crime data, including the Illinois State Police Uniform Crime Reporting Program (I-UCR) and the Annual Security Reports provided by each university (typically available through institutional websites). This was done to highlight that separate data sources can lead to different conclusions and policy recommendations.
