The Chicago Community Trust and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) jointly initiated a comprehensive, long-range planning project for the Chicago region (Cook, DuPage, Kane, Will, Kendall, Lake and McHenry counties) entitled Go To 2040. This planning process encompasses multiple domains of public life including land use, transportation, housing and environmental issues, education, health, workforce development, arts and culture, food security, human relations and public safety. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, along with the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Center for Research in Law and Justice, was selected to provide leadership in the area of crime and justice within the public safety sphere.
