The Lake County Womens Specialized Services Program combines social services and supervision to address the needs of an increasing number of women probationers dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
The specialized probation program offers counseling and education to help participants understand the nature and symptoms of trauma. Following pre-sentence investigations and intake assessments, probationers are referred to services specializing in PTSD and coping strategies, understanding relationships, and parenting. Program participants also are referred to services that address employment, education, finances, child care, housing, physical health, and mental health needs.
This Program Evaluation Summary details the implementation
and impact evaluation of the Lake County Womens Specialized Services Program.
