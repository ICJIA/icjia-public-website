While some is known about domestic sex trafficking victims in the United States, little research is available on the prevalence of trafficking crimes. Recent legislation defines trafficking as a criminal offense, increases penalties for traffickers and those who patronize prostitutes, and aids sex trafficking victims. This Research Bulletin examines Illinois arrest trends by year and Illinois region to gauge the level of response to trafficking- and prostitution-related crimes by law enforcement between 2000 and 2011.
