This report is the fourth in a series of publications on the disproportionate number of African Americans who have been incarcerated for drug crimes in Illinois. The first report in the series examined racial disproportionality in sentences for drug crimes from a national perspective (Lurigio, 2003), the second described the passage of drug laws in Illinois from 1985 to 2002 (Lurigio, Heaps, and Whitney, 2002), and the third focused on racial disparities in sentences for drug crimes in Illinois (Lurigio, 2006). 
TASC and Loyola University Chicago collaborated on these publications as part of the Disproportionate Minority Confinement Workgroup, funded by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and created in response to a 2000 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report that found Illinois led the country in the disproportionate incarceration of African American men for drug crimes, especially compared to White men convicted for the same classes of drug offenses (HRW, 2000). The work group convened to inform the public about drug-related sentencing disparities in Illinois and to encourage a dialogue among criminal justice professionals and politicians who could help remedy the problem.
