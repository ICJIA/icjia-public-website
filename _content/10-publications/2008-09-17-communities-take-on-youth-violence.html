While girls in Illinois commit violent crimes at lower rates than their male counterparts, violent crime arrests of girls have increased over time. Analysis of the Authoritys Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) datasets reveals that violent crime arrest rates of girls between 10 and 16 years old have increased 28 percent since 2000. Felony battery arrests of girls rose nearly 33 percent between 2000 and 2007.
Juvenile justice practitioners say these figures point to a growing need for services geared toward at-risk girls.
