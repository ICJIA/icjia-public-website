Lake County's women's specialized services program aims to provide a higher quality of supervision and services to women offenders who have suffered trauma through empowering the offenders to improve their mental health, familial and intimate relationships, and self-sufficiency so that they may lead productive law-abiding lives and also effectively parent their children in a safe environment. The program aims to prepare women to be more receptive to accepting treatment and service referrals, and through their participation in treatment and services empower women to become law-abiding productive citizens. Probation officers, in conjunction with the Assistant Director of Probation and the Mental Health Evaluator of the Psychological Services Division, select and refer women offenders to trauma counseling based on their traumatic experiences and resulting emotional and cognitive symptoms. This report describes the development of the program.
