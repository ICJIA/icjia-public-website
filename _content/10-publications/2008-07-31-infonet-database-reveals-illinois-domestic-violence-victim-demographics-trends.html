While physical abuse was the top primary presenting form of abuse for domestic violence victims seeking services between 1998 and 2005, victims seeking assistance for emotional abuse increased from 25 percent in 1998 to 41 percent in 2005, according to InfoNet, a web-based data collection and reporting system used by victim service providers in Illinois.
This Research at a Glance examines the characteristics of victims and offenders and types of abuse reported to InfoNet by the centers. Analyses of this data and the trends they reveal are useful in planning and policy making to address the needs of domestic violence victims across Illinois.
