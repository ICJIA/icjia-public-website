It has been approximately three years since the shooting at Virginia Tech University (VT) and two years since the shooting at Northern Illinois University (NIU); remarkably, we still know little about how these two high profile tragedies have affected college life. The more recent February 2010 incident involving a University of Alabama Huntsville professor's shooting of her colleagues has drawn renewed concern about violence on college campuses. To understand how campus officials responded in the wake of the first two shooting events, the authors of this report surveyed campus public safety agencies and their matched community law enforcement agency in a prior study (Giblin, Burruss, & Schafer, 2008). The report detailing the study results, Critical Incident Preparedness and Response on Campus, showed that most surveyed campuses had undertaken rudimentary steps in response to potential critical incidents. Participating campus public safety representatives reported their institutions had: implemented new mass communication technologies, revised emergency response plans, participated in field training exercises, or trained non-­safety personnel in emergency response. Moreover, a majority of agencies rated their capacity to handle critical incidents as fairly high, even though they rated the likelihood of an active shooter event as low.
As the authors disseminated the results of this 2008 study at academic conferences, colleagues asked how students were affected by the tragedies and what they thought of the policy changes. Furthermore, faculty and administrators, including the director of public safety at a large Illinois university, wondered whether students were paying attention to newly implemented critical event communication systems, or whether had they settled back into complacency. Since we had not surveyed students, we could not address these questions, although we realized they were important to answer.
