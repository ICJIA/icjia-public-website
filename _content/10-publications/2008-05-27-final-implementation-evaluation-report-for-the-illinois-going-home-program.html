The Illinois Going Home Program (GH) was conceived with several challenging, policy-level goals that reflect an attempt to refocus the corrections system on rehabilitation. Illinois was asked by federal authorities to design and implement GH without incurring substantial or on-going new expenses. Going Home officials attempted to meet these objectives by establishing three major changes in the way the state of Illinois prepares a prisoner for release into the community from the corrections system.

The evaluation of the Illinois Going Home program was divided into two major pieces  an implementation evaluation and an impact evaluation.  The former documents the extent to which the program itself functioned as planned, while the latter measures the impact of the program on participants.
