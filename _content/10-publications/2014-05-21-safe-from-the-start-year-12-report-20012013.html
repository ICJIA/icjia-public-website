This report summarizes data collected from 4350 children and their families that received Safe From the Start services over the past 12 years. These data provide an important picture of the population of children being referred for violence exposure, the impact of that exposure to violence, and the impact of SFS services. The data indicate a significant reduction in children's emotional and behavioral symptoms and caregiver stress, and an improvement in child and caregiver functioning.
Through collaborative, community-based efforts designed to help families that present with a wide variety of needs, Safe From the Start programs appear to be making a positive impact on the lives of children exposed to violence.
