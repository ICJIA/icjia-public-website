Less than half of all violent victimization crimes occurring in Illinois are reported to police, a percentage that typifies the frequency of crime reporting in the nation as a whole, U.S. Department of Justice statistics indicate. Severe under-reporting to police of all types of crime, including violent crime, is a consistent finding in crime victimization research.
This Research Bulletin summarizes an violent victimization data analysis conducted by Callie Rennison, Ph.D. The analysis, Victim and Household Characteristics: Reporting Violence to the Police, was based on results of the Authority-sponsored Illinois Crime Victimization Survey, a 2002 data collection effort designed to provide indications of victimization across Illinois. A random sample of non-institutionalized Illinois residents 18 years and older and possessing a drivers license or state identification card was surveyed.
