The Lake County Probation Departments womens specialized services program aims to provide a higher quality of supervision and services to women offenders who have suffered trauma through empowering the clients to improve their mental health, familial and intimate relationships, and self-sufficiency so that they may lead productive law-abiding lives and also effectively parent their children in a safe environment. An integral part of this program is psycho-educational trauma counseling that provides participants with information on the nature and symptoms of trauma in their lives, on Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and coping strategies, healthy and unhealthy relationships, parenting, and the community based resources and treatments that are available to address basic survival needs, mental health treatment, and substance abuse treatment.
