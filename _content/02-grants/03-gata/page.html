<h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Grant Accountability and Transparency at ICJIA</h2>

    <p><a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3559&ChapterID=7">The
      Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) of 2014</a>, 30 ILCS 708/1 et seq.,
      increased accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds
       and reduced the administrative burden on state agencies
       and grantees through adoption of federal grant guidelines and regulations.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Act, the Grant Accountability and
Transparency Unit (GATU) was established within the Governor's Office of Management and Budget; GATU is charged with implementation of the Act in coordination with state grant-making agencies and nonprofit organizations in Illinois. GATA requires grants administered by state agencies to be awarded in a competitive bidding process. In addition, all applicants must undergo a registration and pre-award screening process.
This competitive grant award process is initiated with a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).</p>
