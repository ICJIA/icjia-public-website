summary: "Data Driven Justice is a national bipartisan initiative organized by the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. The initiative focuses on how local jurisdictions can use data-driven strategies to safely reduce the overreliance on incarceration of superutilizers, that is, people who have mental illness and/or substance abuse disorders and cycle repeatedly through justice and healthcare systems at great cost to taxpayers. The state of Illinois and several individual counties, including Cook, Champaign, Lake, and McLean, joined Data Driven Justice Initiative in 2016. "

                <p>The state of Illinois and select local jurisdictions are official partners in the new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/datadrivenjustice">White House Data Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ)</a>. Launched in June of 2016, DDJ is a nationwide effort to reduce the financial and human costs associated with incarcerating people in local jails who may have complex needs but do not pose a risk to public safety. Using cross-system data, improved technology and collaborative strategies, state and local decision makers can achieve better outcomes, particularly by focusing on a special population of “super-utilizers” of emergency departments and jails.</p>

<p>John Maki, <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us">Illinois Criminal Justice Authority (ICJIA)</a> Executive Director, is leading the state’s participation in the DDJ Initiative. "If we can identify [super-utilizers] in real-time when or before they enter the system, we can treat them, rather than letting them sink deeper into our criminal justice system, and into a costly cycle of dependence," said Maki.</p>

<p>As part of DDJ, the ICJIA is joining with the Illinois Health and Hospital Administration (IHA) and other partners to coordinate a statewide solution-focused convening for county health and justice leaders. The one-day convening and ongoing learning collaborative will provide local stakeholders and decision makers with the opportunity to share best practices and learn from each other about identifying and addressing the needs of super-utilizers.</p>

<p>Participation in the DDJ Initiative is consistent with and complementary to bold efforts underway in Illinois to reform the health and justice systems. In 2015, Governor Bruce Rauner began a Health and Human Services Transformation process and created the <a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/cjreform2015">Illinois State Commission on Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform</a>, an initiative to reduce Illinois’ incarcerated population by 25 percent by 2025.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6" >
        <p>The White House announced the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/datadrivenjustice">Data Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ)</a> in June of 2016. DDJ is a nationwide call to action for state and local decision makers to optimize their early diversion work with the help of advancements in data and technology.</p>

        <p>Each year, it costs over $22 billion to move the 11 million individuals in America’s local jails.  Over 60 % are awaiting trial and not yet convicted, many charged with non-violent misdemeanor offenses. More than half of these 11 million individuals have mental illness, substance use disorder, and other chronic medical conditions. Jailing those with serious mental illness and other chronic medical problems is costly, ineffective, and detrimental to the community.</p>

          <p>States, counties, and cities across the country have begun implementing protocols and programs to divert people away from the justice system and into more appropriate care, such as an outpatient treatment for mental illness. </p>

      </div>


      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6" >

<p> In doing this work, people recognized that services to a small portion of these individuals--the "super utilizers"--are disproportionately costly to the community. Super utilizers often cycle in and out of several community systems including the justice and health systems without a long-term treatment plan.</p>
<p>The goal is for counties to be able to identify and possibly even predict these super-utilizers before they are caught in the revolving door of the justice system. The state of Illinois and several Illinois counties have signed on to DDJ in an effort to catch people in need of care before they are chronically involved with the health and justice systems.</p>
