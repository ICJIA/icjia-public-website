At this meeting, Authority staff will give an overview of our grant making process. To that end, staff members have put together a manual that describes our federal funding sources for your reference. As you’ll see, we have prefaced the manual with an Authority Resolution, adopted in 2001, that establishes ten Grant Making Principles, which we think provides strategic and inspiring guidance for our work.<br> <br><br></p>'

<p>A correction has been made to the Funding Prospectus section of the Gun Violence Reduction Strategies budget designation form in the materials. The MacArthur and Joyce Foundation funds will be used in addition to the JAG funds, not to reimburse JAG funds. In addition, minor budget line adjustments totaling $204 were made to more accurately reflect projected expenses.</p>
<p>Staff will be available at the Budget Committee meeting to answer any questions.</p>
