summary: Securing employment after exiting prison can be challenging, but some reentry programs seek to help formerly incarcerated individuals gain employment. One type of program provides entrepreneurship training to help individuals open their own small business. ICJIA researchers conducted an outcome evaluation of an entrepreneurship program in Cook County Illinois, Pathway to Enterprise for Returning Citizens (PERC) to examine recidivism outcomes. Researchers employed a randomized control trial to compare outcomes after prison release of 97 formerly incarcerated individuals—72 participants in the program and 25 in the comparison group. The study found no programmatic effects as there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on the outcomes of rearrest, reincarceration, and employment.
