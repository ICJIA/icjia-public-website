The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority received a grant from the Illinois Department of Human Services for the Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission to create the Juvenile Justice System and Risk Factor Data for Illinois: 2006 Annual Report. In an effort to present a broad range of relevant data to juvenile justice professionals, this report's aim is to be as comprehensive as possible in reporting juvenile justice data.

Additionally, this report presents a brief explanation of risk factors and their importance to the juvenile justice system. Together, these data can assist juvenile justice system policymakers and practitioners in developing informed planning and policy initiatives.

Appendix H: Data tables section - The following data tables include county-level detail for several dozen juvenile justice data elements. When available, some data elements were also broken down by demographics, such as age, race, and gender. Data is provided by calendar year or Fiscal Year, depending upon the reporting agency. Whenever possible, both 1999 and 2006 data were included.

The Juvenile Justice System and Risk Factor Data: 2006 Annual Report can be viewed in PDF at http://www.icjia.state.il.us/public/pdf/ResearchReports/Juvenile%20Justice%20System%20and%20Risk%20Factor%20Data%202006%20Annual%20Report.pdf or view the data online at http://www.icjia.state.il.us/public/index.cfm?metasection=data under the Illinois Juvenile Justice System and Risk Factor Data for Illinois: Annual Reports section.
