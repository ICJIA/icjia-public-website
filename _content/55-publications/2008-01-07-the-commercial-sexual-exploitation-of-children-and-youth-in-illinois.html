The commercial sexual exploitation of children has received increased national attention in recent years. Government officials have shown growing concern for young people exploited for commercial sex. The victims are just as often U.S. citizens as they are foreign-born and secreted into the states. Due to the hidden nature of commercial sexual exploitation of children, it is difficult to study and quantify the problem.
In the fall 2006, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded a research grant by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency (OJJDP) to study the commercial sexual exploitation of children. OJJDP defines commercial sexual exploitation of children as a constellation of crimes of a sexual nature committed against youthful victims younger than 18 years old primarily or entirely for financial or other economic reasons. These crimes include, for example, trafficking for sexual purposes, prostitution, sex tourism, mail-order-bride trade and early marriage, pornography, stripping, and sexual performances.
Three research methods were utilized in this study, including arrest statistics, focus groups with individuals who were prostituted as juveniles, and interviews with law enforcement officers. The overall goal of the research was to gain a better understanding of the commercial sexual exploitation of children and youth.
