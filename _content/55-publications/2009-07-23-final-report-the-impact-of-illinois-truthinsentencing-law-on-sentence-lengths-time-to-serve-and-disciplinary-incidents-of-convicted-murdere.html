Following the passage of the federal TIS grant program, Illinois formed a Truth-in-Sentencing Commission to examine Illinois current sentencing policies and determined that the state should adopt its own version of TIS. Illinois adopted its version of TIS in August 1995 (State Fiscal Year 1996), which requires those convicted of murder to serve 100 percent of their sentence, those convicted of criminal sexual assault to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence, and those sentenced to prison for other violent crimes involving great bodily harm to also serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. Prior to the implementation of TIS in Illinois, those sentenced to prison for murder and criminal sexual assault served, on average, less than 40 percent of their sentences as a result of the various Good Conduct Credit (GCC), Meritorious Good Time (MGT), and Supplemental Meritorious Good Time (SMGT) reductions (Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, 1994).
