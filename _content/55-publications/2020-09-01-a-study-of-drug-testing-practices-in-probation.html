summary: Individuals on probation often are subject to drug testing regardless of conviction offenses. Positive test results can lead to probation sanctions, technical violations, and revocations, which, for some, may result in a period of incarceration. Probation departments operate with lack of guidance on drug testing, as well as a lack of research on drug testing’s impact on reducing recidivism or improving behavioral health. In a survey of a statewide random sample of Illinois probation departments, the current research examined the landscape of probation policies and procedures and drug testing administration. The survey revealed many probation departments did not randomly test probation clients, often responded to positive drug tests with punitive measures, and infrequently offered positive feedback, or contingency management, for negative test results.
