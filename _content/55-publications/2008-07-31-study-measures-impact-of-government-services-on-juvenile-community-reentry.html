Research suggests incarcerated juveniles face many challenges as they transition back into the community. To examine how services provided by schools, public aid, foster care, and other government programs impact youth re-entry and recidivism in Illinois, researchers analyzed administrative data from a variety ofstate and local agencies that provide assistance to juveniles.

This Research Brief details re-entry experiences of juveniles, ages 13 to 18, released from Illinois juvenile correctional facilities between 1996 and 2003, as revealed in the research study From corrections to community: The juvenile reentry experience as characterized by multiple systems involvement.
