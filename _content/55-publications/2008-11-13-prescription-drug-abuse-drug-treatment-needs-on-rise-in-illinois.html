While the use of street drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, has declined in recent decades, prescription drug abuse is on the rise.

The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates 7 million Americans are abusing prescription drugs, an increase of 80 percent since 2002. The Partnership for a Drug Free America estimates that nearly one in five teens has abused prescription drugs. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimates about 500,000 Illinois residents are using prescription drugs illegally and in ways that can lead to dependence and even death. Treatment admissions also are increasing in Illinois for prescription
drug abuse.
