    The Adult Redeploy Illinois 2014 Annual Report is now available on the ARI website. The report provides local jurisdictions, policymakers, and the general public important information on progress to-date in the initiative.
    
    2014 was a year of continued growth for Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI). The number of non-violent offenders supervised at ARI sites increased 33 percent, from 1,275 in 2013 to 1,698 in 2014.
    
    From 2011-2014, more than 2,100 non-violent offenders were diverted from prison which represents about $46.5 million in potential cost savings to the state by providing local supervision and services instead of sending these individuals to prison.
