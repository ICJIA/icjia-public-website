In 2013, the Parent Program component provided 1,010 parents in 21 Chicago-area communities training and then coordinated their participation in community service projects. The Parent Program is one of three programs offered through the Community Violence Prevention Program (CVPP). Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) researchers used administrative data and developed four surveys to evaluate the Parent Program and answer key research questions. These included a training evaluation survey, a pre- and post-survey (given at the beginning and end of the program), and two exit surveys.
