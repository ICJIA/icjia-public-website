summary: The way in which probation and parole officers communicate and interact can impact outcomes for their clients. This literature review examines strategies geared towards enhancing outcomes for individuals under correctional supervision—core correctional practices and motivational interviewing. These practices have been found to generate more positive outcomes for individuals on probation or parole (community supervision), such as reduced recidivism rates, increased prosocial skill development, and increased interest/retention in treatment, when compared with traditional methods of correctional supervision that tend to focus more on client risk management and compliance with conditions of supervision.
