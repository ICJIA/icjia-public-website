The  Critical Incident Preparedness and  Response on Campus research project was designed to describe the current  practices of campuses with respect to critical incident prevention and  response, paying particular attention to coordination with local law  enforcement agencies.
This  report is being released to the public near the first anniversary of the  February 14, 2008 shootings on the campus of Northern Illinois University  (NIU).  The content of this report is  particularly relevant to those interested in campus public safety, especially  in light of two campus shooting incidents occurring within the course of a year  in DeKalb, Illinois and Blacksburg, Virginia.  
The impetus for this research project was the  Virginia Tech (VT) shooting incident in April 2007; the authors observed in  both Illinois and nationally the creation of commissions to examine campus  safety issues as well prescriptions for improving security.  One of the key questions guiding the research  was whether any new preparedness steps were taken.  This report frames many of the findings and implications  within the context of the VT shootings because the research was focused on  change pursuant to that tragedy.  Data  were collected beginning in April 2008 to study the changes campuses had  pursued in the first year after the VT incident.
