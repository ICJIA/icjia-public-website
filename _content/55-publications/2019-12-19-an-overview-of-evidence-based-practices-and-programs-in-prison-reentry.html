summary: Individuals released from prison often face immediate challenges related to employment, housing, behavioral health, and social support. While high recidivism rates among returning citizens continue to be an issue in many communities, certain reentry programs have shown effectiveness in improving outcomes for released individuals. This article provides an overview of reentry needs and best practices for reentry programming. Examples of promising reentry programs are provided. Strategies for parole officers are briefly discussed, as parole is often directly related to the reentry process. Evidence-based practices have emerged from the existing research on reentry, but high-quality, replicable research on programming will continue to be necessary to advance the “what works” discourse.
