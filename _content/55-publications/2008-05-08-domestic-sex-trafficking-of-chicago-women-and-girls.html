The purpose of this research project was to obtain more information about the process by which young girls are recruited into the sex trade industry in the Chicago metropolitan area including strategies used, and levels of coercion, control, and violence that hold them in prostitution. The researchers hypothesized that dishonest recruitment tactics and outright coercion are employed; the same tactics in international human trafficking are to meet the demand for prostituted young women in Chicago. Researchers also set out to determine where girls were active in the sex trade, whether they are transported to prostitution venues, how far they are transported, and whether they are taken across state lines.
