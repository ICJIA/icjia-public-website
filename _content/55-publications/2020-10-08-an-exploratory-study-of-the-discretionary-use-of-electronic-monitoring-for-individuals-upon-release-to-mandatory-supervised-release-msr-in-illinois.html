summary: Research is limited on the use of electronic monitoring for individuals released from state correctional institutions. Available research indicates mixed results as to the efficacy of electronic monitoring in deterring individuals from committing technical violations—or violations of their conditions of release—and future criminal offending behavior. Further, the risks for collateral consequences (e.g. stigma, difficulty finding employment, disruption to family life) and potential net-widening are concerns. For the present study, we examined the discretionary use of electronic monitoring and its impact on individuals exiting the Illinois Department of Corrections on mandatory supervised release in state fiscal year 2016. We analyzed departmental policies, Prisoner Review Board orders, and conducted propensity score matching to compare outcomes of those who were and were not ordered to electronic monitoring as a condition of their release. Recommendations based on the study findings are provided.
