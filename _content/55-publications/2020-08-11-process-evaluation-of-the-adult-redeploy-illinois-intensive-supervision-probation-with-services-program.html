summary: Intensive Supervision Probation (ISP) programs are enhanced community correction programs that generally include increased surveillance. The Intensive Supervision Probation with Services model (ISP-S) uses an integrated approach that includes increased surveillance, treatment, and other evidence-based or promising practices for its participants. Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) supports several ISP-S programs in Illinois. This study evaluated the implementation of four such models and found multiple strengths, including strong collaboration, teamwork, level of commitment, adherence to the program model, and use of community resources.
