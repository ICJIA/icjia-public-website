Detailed statewide statistical data is needed to inform juvenile justice
 policy decisions. The Illinois Criminal History Record System offers 
promise, and has been used with some success, but its full potential for
 statistical purposes has not been systematically evaluated. This report
 provides such an assessment, focusing on the completeness of the 
juvenile arrest and court information collected by the CHRI System in 
light of state statutes that govern reporting practices.
