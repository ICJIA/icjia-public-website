This study was conducted to add to the understanding of juveniles incarcerated in Illinois by examining re-arrest and re-incarceration of 3,052 juveniles released from the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) in state fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007. This report provides a detailed summary of youth exiting IDJJ after a full delinquency commitment, from demographics and offending history to recidivism into the adult system.
