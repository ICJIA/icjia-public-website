pubstatatus: 'true'
summary: This study examined the connection between criminal arrests and prison admissions and an outcome of violent death defined as either a homicide or suicide. We examined Illinois Violent Death Reporting System (IVDRS) data from death certificates, the coroner/medical examiner, law enforcement, and toxicology and autopsy reports, and linked with state arrest and prison data. We examined a sample of 3,175 adults who suffered a violent death in Illinois from 2015 and 2016. Of suicide victims, we found 40% had a prior arrest and 3% had a prior incarceration. Of homicide victims, we found 77% had a prior arrest and 31% had a prior incarceration. This indicates a relationship between criminal offending and victimization by homicide.
