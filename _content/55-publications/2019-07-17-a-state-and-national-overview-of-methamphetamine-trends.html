summary: While most of the country has turned its attention to the opioid crisis, Illinois has seen a resurgence in methamphetamine misuse and related offending, particularly in rural areas. Researchers explored literature and data available on the extent and nature of state and national methamphetamine issues. Researchers found the arrest rate for methamphetamine-related offenses more than tripled between 2010 and 2017 in Illinois and the number of individuals in Illinois prisons for methamphetamine offenses increased 67 percent between 2012 and 2018. Further, treatment admissions for methamphetamine increased five-fold between 2000 and 2017.
