summary: National and state-level research points to higher rates of crime victimization, such as bullying, harassment, intimate partner violence, among individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+). Following victimization, victims may share their experiences with informal supports (i.e., social networks) and/or formal supports (i.e., physician, social service case manager) for help. In this qualitative study, researchers examined the experiences of 13 LGBTQ+ victims in Illinois who had disclosed their victimization. Findings suggest LGBTQ+ victims share about their experiences for various reasons, such as an acute need for help or being asked if something was wrong, but that the reason for disclosure varies by support source. Implications point to the importance of improving support source responses to victimization disclosure and LGBTQ+ victims; avenues for future research related to disclosure processes are also identified.
