summary: Violence is one of the top three leading causes of death for individuals between the ages of 15 and 34 in the United States, and the American Public Health Association and Centers for Disease Control have designated violence a public health crisis. Important to combating this crisis are behavioral and public health professionals and practitioners who directly work to prevent violence. The present study sought to understand behavioral and public health providers’ competencies, capacities, comfort, confidence, and preparedness in violence prevention. Results from a survey of 152 respondents indicated there are areas for improving the education and training around violence prevention, as well as legal and ethical liabilities among practitioners. Further, few practitioners reported receiving client referrals from law enforcement agencies.
