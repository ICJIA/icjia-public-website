summary: Mass incarceration in the United States has disproportionately impacted racial and ethnic minorities, particularly those residing in concentrated urban areas. In Illinois, almost half of individuals returning from prison are released in Chicago; of those, about half return to neighborhoods on the city’s West and South sides. Research has found that incarceration may, in fact, increase crime as a result of negative consequences to the formerly incarcerated, their families, and their communities. This article reviews literature on the prevalence, causes, and consequences of community concentration of prison admissions and returns. Illinois-specific data on prison admissions and exits are provided.
