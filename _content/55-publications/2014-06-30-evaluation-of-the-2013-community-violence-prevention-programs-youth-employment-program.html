In 2013, the Community Violence Prevention Programs Youth Employment Program (YEP) offered job readiness training, mentoring, and summer employment to approximately 1,800 youth participants in 24 Chicago-area communities. The evaluation of YEP was designed to guide programmatic enhancements and funding decisions. Researchers used multiple surveys of program staff and participants in order to obtain feedback on trainings for participants, the employment component, mentoring component, and general program operations. The program met its goals of increasing job readiness skills; building relationships between youth and a caring adult; increasing youth productive time and community engagement; and improving the community through community service.
