Between July and December 2007, the Authority collaborated with the Schiller DuCanto & Fleck Family Law Center at DePaul University College of Law to research how young girls are recruited into the sex trade in the Chicago metropolitan area, including strategies used, and levels of coercion, control, and violence that hold them in prostitution. Researchers examined how dishonest recruitment tactics and outright coercion are employed to meet the demand for prostituted young women in Chicago. Researchers also set out to determine the types of venues in which young women traded sex and where and how far they were transported.
