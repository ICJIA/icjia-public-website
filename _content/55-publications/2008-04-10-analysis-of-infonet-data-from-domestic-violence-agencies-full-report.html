The analyses presented here were conducted in order to look more fully at these issues. They build upon our previous work examining both domestic violence data and sexual assault/abuse information for the Illinois Criminal Justice and Information Authority (ICJIA) (Grossman & Lundy, 2000; Grossman & Lundy, 2004). The domestic violence data with which we worked made clear that there were differences in the circumstances of abuse, paths into referral and assessed service need for some groups, including victims of color versus those who were White, older versus younger victims and victims in rural settings compared to those in Cook County. Variations in difficulties among children related to their characteristics, as well as the characteristics of the abuse situation were also identified. The data which were used in these analyses, however, were older data, predating the InfoNet system and, as such, limited in time (no later than 1995) and depth. The sexual assault and abuse data we worked with allowed us to look at a broader range of variables in more recent time, but because these data focused on victims of sexual assault and/or abuse, they did not provide further clarification on the experience of victims of domestic violence (although some of the victims in the sexual assault/abuse data were also victims of such abuse).
