summary: Economic development encourages growth in the economy, increases employer and worker productivity, and enhances the standard of living for all. Economic development is essential in the effort against poverty. Programmatic interventions that promote a healthy economy while alleviating poverty in communities include skill-building to improve the quality of labor supply and/or increasing the demand for workers. However, experimental evidence and guidance about best practices in the field of economic development are limited. This article examines the relationship between poverty, risk factors for criminal offending, and economic development programming. By successfully addressing economic disparity, poverty, and other risk factors, policymakers can encourage economic development, reduce crime, and positively impact communities throughout the state.
