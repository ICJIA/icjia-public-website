summary: Domestic violence is a national public health issue that both federal and state funding work to address. Researchers analyzed data collected via InfoNet, a statewide case management and data reporting system used by domestic violence agencies across Illinois, and other state administrative data, to identify trends among those who have been harmed by domestic violence. Researchers found shifts in the number and characteristics of clients served, including an increase in clients who are veterans, older adults, and those who shared child custody with the offender. However, further research is needed to fully understand the unique needs of these client groups and how funding shifts may impact services in Illinois.
