summary: U.S. veterans have made significant contributions to American freedom and many have risked their lives to defend the country. Some suffer a range of poor physical and behavioral health outcomes upon returning to civilian life, putting them at greater risk for criminal justice involvement. Military veterans comprise a small but noteworthy percentage of the justice-involved population. Research suggests military service may contribute to aggression; 64 percent of veterans in U.S. prisons were sentenced for a violent offense and of those, one-third are serving time for a violent sexual offense. This article examines veteran needs that, when unmet, may contribute to justice involvement, as well as programs designed to address those needs. Veteran-specific services, including veteran treatment courts, may be critical for improving treatment outcomes. Future research directions and recommendations also are discussed.
