Researchers from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority and the WestCare Foundation interviewed 50 re-incarcerated participants of Illinois Sheridan Correctional Center National Model Drug Prison and Reentry Program. Sheridan is a fully-dedicated therapeutic community for adult male inmates, providing substance abuse treatment and aftercare. Research has shown reductions in recidivism among Sheridan graduates compared to other prisoners. This study identified contributors to the former Sheridan participants re-incarceration. The information and insights garnered from the inmates on the Sheridan program, aftercare, and parole may support program enhancements.
