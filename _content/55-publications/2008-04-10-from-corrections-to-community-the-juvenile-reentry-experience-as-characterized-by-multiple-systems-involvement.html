In this study, we examined reentry experiences of a population of youth released from Illinois juvenile correctional facilities between 1996 and 2003. Prior research suggests that these youth are likely to face considerable challenges as they navigate the transition back into the
  community. The needs of these youth may place them in contact with one or several childserving systems, which may indicate both need and support received during the transition. Involvement in multiple systems is viewed in this research as being part of the reentry
experience that is likely to impact the chances of re-offending.
Using administrative data from a variety of human and public service systems that serve children and youth in Illinois, we developed profiles of reentry experiences, as characterized by varying levels of involvement across multiple systems after release from correctional settings among eight cohorts of youth. Reentry experiences were compared across age, gender, and race. Using multilevel modeling techniques, the study also examined how different reentry experiences are related to recidivism following release and how the relationship between these experiences and recidivism varies by social context.
