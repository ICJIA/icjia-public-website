summary: Rape crisis centers provide crisis counseling, victim advocacy, mental health services, and community education free at the point of service in Illinois. This study sought to understand how Illinois rape crisis centers were affected by the two-year state budget impasse (2015 to 2017), during which many social service programs were unsupported by state funding. Analyzing administrative data from 29 rape crisis centers, we found statistically significant yet minimal decreases in hours of service provided to victims for criminal justice advocacy, individual counseling, and telephone counseling. Findings showed that despite substantial funding loss during the budget impasse, rape crisis centers managed to continue serving sexual violence survivors though several service categories were affected. Findings underscored the effect state budgets can have on service provision, the importance of unrestricted funds, and the need for rape crisis centers to initiate budget planning and resource development to the best of their abilities to be prepared for, and overcome, future fiscal crises. This study is especially salient given the economic downturn projected due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which may hit state budgets particularly hard.
