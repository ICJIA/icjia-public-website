summary: "Nearly one-third of Illinois probationers suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD). Despite evidence that FDA-approved medications—methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone—can effectively treat OUD, many probation departments do not allow their clients to use them, even when prescribed by a healthcare provider. ICJIA researchers surveyed probation departments across the state to better understand their familiarity with, and training on, the medications, as well as barriers to their clients' access and use. This article summarizes the study’s findings."
