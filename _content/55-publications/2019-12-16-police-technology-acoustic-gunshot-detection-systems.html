summary: Police departments continually adopt new technology to improve how they investigate and solve crime. Acoustic gunshot detection systems (AGDs) such as ShotSpotter use sound sensors to locate gunshots in a community, improve response times, determine how many shooters are in an area, and identify the types of firearms being used. This article features a literature review on AGDs. Limited research has shown AGDs are reliable in detecting shots fired, but less is known on whether the systems contribute to a reduction in gun crime.
