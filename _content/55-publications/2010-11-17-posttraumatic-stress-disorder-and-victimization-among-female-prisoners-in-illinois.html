Post-traumatic stress disorder and victimization among female prisoners in Illinois summarizes a study involving interviews with 163 randomly-selected female prisoners at Illinois Department of Corrections facilities. Study participants were asked questions on prior victimization in their lives, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were gauged using the PTSD Symptoms Checklist. Findings indicated that many female prisoners have or previously experienced PTSD symptoms. In addition, those who experienced any childhood abuse, more severe abuse, and sexual abuse were more likely to experience PTSD or greater levels of PTSD. These findings indicate needs for services to treat female prisoners suffering from PTSD. This report is the second in a series of reports by the Authority on victimization among female prison inmates.
