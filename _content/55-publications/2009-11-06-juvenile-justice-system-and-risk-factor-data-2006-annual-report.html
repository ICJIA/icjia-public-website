The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority received a grant from the Illinois Department of Human Services for the Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission to create the Juvenile Justice System and Risk Factor Data for Illinois: 2006 Annual Report. In an effort to present a broad range of relevant data to juvenile justice professionals, this report's aim is to be as comprehensive as possible in reporting juvenile justice data. Additionally, this report presents a brief explanation of risk factors and their importance to the juvenile justice system. Together, these data can assist juvenile justice system policymakers and practitioners in developing informed planning and policy initiatives.
