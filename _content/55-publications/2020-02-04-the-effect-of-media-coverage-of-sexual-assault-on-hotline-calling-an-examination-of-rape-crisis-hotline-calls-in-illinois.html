summary: News reports have documented increases in calls to rape crisis hotlines after periods of intense coverage of sexual assault cases in the media. Hotline call data collected from InfoNet, a web-based data collection and reporting system used by victim service providers in Illinois, was used to examine the relationship between daily hotline calls and the coverage of sexual assault in the media over the past 17 years. While evidence was found for exceptionally high call volume coinciding with the confirmation process of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as well as calls related to a local media awareness event promoting the hotline, other high-profile cases were not consistently linked to increased calls. This article provides an initial exploration into how high-profile events may impact hotline calls and notes the importance of establishing a baseline when using hotline call tallies as a measure of media impact on victim help-seeking.
