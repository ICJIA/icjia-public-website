summary: Illinois law enforcement agencies reported 118,160 domestic-related crimes in 2016. The Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council developed and provided training for police and other criminal justice practitioners to improve knowledge about domestic violence and apply this knowledge to support evidence-based approaches to prosecution and orders of protection. This article presents findings from 28 training evaluations held between September 2015 and September 2017. These evaluations provided evidence of some improvement post-training in confidence and knowledge of domestic violence and increased knowledge of promising practices to collect evidence for and investigate domestic violence and abuse cases.
