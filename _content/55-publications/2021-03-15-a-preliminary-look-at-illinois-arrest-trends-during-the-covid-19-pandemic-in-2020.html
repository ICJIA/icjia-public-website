summary: Jurisdictions across the United States are seeing a reduction in reported crime and arrests coinciding with COVID-19. This article offers a preliminary look at arrest trends during the COVID-19 pandemic across Illinois. Researchers examined arrest data from the Illinois State Police Criminal History Record Information database to identify arrest trends prior to and after the state’s stay-at home order was issued in March 2020 and compare them to trends recorded in previous years. Statewide, arrests recorded over the duration of the stay-at-home order, which lasted from March 21 to June 25, 2020, were much lower than those recorded during that period in 2019. Researchers also identified a drop in homicide, drug possession, drug manufacture and delivery, and domestic violence arrests in the two weeks preceding Illinois’ stay-at-home order. Finally, while arrests increased statewide from May to June 2020, arrests dropped in Chicago.
