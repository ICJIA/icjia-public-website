The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is pleased to announce publication of the Final Report of the Task Force on Inventorying Employment Restrictions.
Illinois Public Act 96-0593 (20 ILCS 5000) created this Task Force within the Authority, and provides that the Task Force review statutes, administrative rules, policies, and practices that restrict employment of persons with criminal history and report its findings and recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly by July 1, 2013.
Gainful employment after release from prison is one of the critical elements necessary to achieve successful reentry, and employment has been shown to reduce recidivism. It is our expectation that the information and recommendations in this report will help empower the State's agencies, boards, and commissions to assume a leadership role in providing employment opportunities to people with criminal records while guarding against inappropriate discrimination.
