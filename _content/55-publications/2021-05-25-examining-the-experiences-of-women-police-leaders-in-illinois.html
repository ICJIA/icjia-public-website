summary: Research indicates women are strong assets to police departments, but they may encounter barriers when attempting to enter the male-dominated field of policing. This study examined the experiences of six female police leaders in Illinois to learn about the challenges they faced and to discover how police departments can recruit, support, and retain women officers, particularly those interested in promotion. The interviews suggested that mentorship and close relationships with other officers can provide guidance and help cope with the stress that comes with being a female officer. Enforced policies against harassment and discrimination can help retain women in the profession and encourage them to safely pursue promotion. Finally, targeted recruitment strategies that highlight the service aspects of policing may inspire others to join, as well as be an early step in assisting departments with being reflective of the communities they serve.
