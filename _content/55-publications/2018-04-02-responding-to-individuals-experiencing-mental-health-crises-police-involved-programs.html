summary: As many as 10 percent of police contacts involve individuals with mental health conditions. A growing number of police and sheriff’s departments have implemented specialized responses to mental health crisis incidents, including crisis intervention teams (CIT). Research indicates departments offering specialized responses show greater officer knowledge of mental health conditions and more positive police attitudes toward individuals with mental health conditions. However, limited empirical support exists for considering other outcomes evidence-based. This article examines specialized mental health responses with an emphasis on practices in Illinois and offers implications for future research and practice.
