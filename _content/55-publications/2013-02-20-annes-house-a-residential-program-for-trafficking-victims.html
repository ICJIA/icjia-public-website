Opened by the Salvation Army in 2010, Annes House is the first long-term, residential program in the Chicago area for young women and girls who were victims of sex trafficking. The program offers comprehensive residential services to sex trafficking victims and was designed to address the limited number of shelters and services available for this unique population.
