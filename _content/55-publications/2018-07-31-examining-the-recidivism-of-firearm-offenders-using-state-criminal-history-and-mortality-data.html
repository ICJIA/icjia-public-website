summary: In this study, researchers compared recidivism rates of individuals initially arrested for gun charges with individuals arrested for other offenses. The researchers also used state criminal history records, state prison records, and death certificates to follow individuals for 10 years after their first firearm arrest. Findings offer relevant insights into first-time, firearm-involved arrestees, their recidivism patterns, and mortality rates, and inform policy and practice on the issue of guns and violence.
