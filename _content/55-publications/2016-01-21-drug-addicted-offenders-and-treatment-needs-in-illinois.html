Last year, 45 percent of the 28,612 Illinois Department of Corrections inmates screened for substance abuse upon prison entry were deemed in need of treatment. Research has clearly and consistently documented the connection between drug use and criminal offending. Individuals who use illegal drugs are more likely to commit crimes while they are under the influence. Nearly 75 percent of the 2.3 million prison inmates in the United States meet criteria for substance abuse or addiction.
