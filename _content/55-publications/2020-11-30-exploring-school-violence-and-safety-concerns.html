summary: Although school violence is not a new phenomenon, school safety continues to be a leading public health concern, particularly following high-profile school shootings. In response to these events, many schools have quickly implemented strategies to enhance safety, but research indicates certain responses may actually worsen student well-being. This literature review is the first in a two-part series providing an overview of factors that can affect school safety, including school climate, bullying, and school violence.
