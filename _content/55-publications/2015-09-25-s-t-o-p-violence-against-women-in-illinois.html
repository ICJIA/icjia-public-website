<p>The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), authorized by Title IV of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and subsequently reauthorized as the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 and 2013, provides financial assistance to states for developing and strengthening effective law enforcement and prosecution strategies and victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women. To be eligible, states must develop a plan in accordance with requirements set out in the Act. The Act specifies that states must allocate at least 25 percent of the VAWA funds it receives to law enforcement, 25 percent to prosecution, 30 percent to nonprofit, non-governmental victim services, and at least 5 percent to courts. The remaining 15 percent may be allocated at the stateâ€™s discretion within the parameters of the Act. Funds may not be used to replace dollars already committed to a service or program.</p>

<p>The current STOP VAWA Implementation Plan will guide the use of the STOP VAWA awards received by the State of Illinois for a three-year period, 2014 through 2016. The plan will be introduced for approval by the Authority Board at its June 6, 2014 meeting. The plan is organized in the format pursuant to the 2013 STOP VAWA reauthorization and explained in the 2014 application. </p>
