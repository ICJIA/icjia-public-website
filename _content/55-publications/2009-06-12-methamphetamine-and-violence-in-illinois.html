Methamphetamine has spread eastward from Hawaii and California to other parts of the country, including the Midwest. Despite aggressive efforts by state and federal governments the problem persists and has been particularly visible in rural areas of the Midwest. Responding to the problem has been made more difficult because social science research on methamphetamine lags, even though the number of recent methamphetamine users is about the same as the number of recent crack cocaine users  a group that has been extensively studied (SAMHSA, 2006).
Beyond a lack of basic information about methamphetamines in rural areas there is a need for research on the association between methamphetamine and violence. Public perceptions notwithstanding, there is very little empirically based knowledge about the association between methamphetamine and violence. This study was designed to fill gaps in knowledge about the problem.
