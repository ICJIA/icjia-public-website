summary: The special issue of the Journal for Advancing Justice featured papers that reflect critical issues in the emerging field of law enforcement deflection and prearrest diversion programs (hereafter collectively referred to as deflection). Deflection is a collaborative intervention connecting public safety (e.g., police, sheriffs) and public health systems to create community-based pathways to treatment for people who have substance use disorders (SUDs), mental health disorders, or both, and who often have other service needs, without their entry into the justice system. The deflection pathways, discussed later in more detail, facilitate connections to treatment, recovery, housing, and social services via case management. In this way, deflection provides a new, third option for police—an alternative to the traditional choices of making an arrest or taking no action—when encountering individuals whose behavioral health conditions may be factors underlying their contact with law enforcement, with or without the presence of criminal activity. Deflection can enable individuals to receive referrals to services without fear of arrest or can be offered in lieu of arrest when charges are present and an arrest would have otherwise occurred. Evolving over the past decade, with almost all growth occurring during the last four years (2016 to 2020), deflection has manifold aims. It seeks to promote the well-being of individuals, improve public safety, address racial inequities, shift social service responses from police to behavioral health and housing, keep families intact, reduce jail overcrowding, and improve relations between police and the community. This special issue features articles focusing on how deflection program models operate and potential best practices for the field.
