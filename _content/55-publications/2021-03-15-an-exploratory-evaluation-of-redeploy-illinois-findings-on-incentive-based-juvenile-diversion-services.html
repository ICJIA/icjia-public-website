summary: Research indicates that diverting youth from formal justice system processing can prevent future youth justice contact and system involvement. The Illinois Department of Human Services seeks to accomplish this through providing individualized treatment services to reduce recidivism and admissions to state youth correctional facilities as part of its Redeploy Illinois program. This study provides an exploratory analysis of Redeploy Illinois, seeking to determine the characteristics of youth served by the program, as well as the feasibility of collecting and analyzing data for potential outcome evaluations. We collected and analyzed data on 775 youth in the Redeploy Illinois program from June 2009 to September 2019. A general data audit on the Redeploy Illinois case management system was conducted for completeness, quality and accuracy of data. Recommendations based on the study findings are provided.
