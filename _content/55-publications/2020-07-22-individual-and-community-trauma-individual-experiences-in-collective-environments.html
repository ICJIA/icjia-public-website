summary: Trauma, which refers to an emotional response from circumstances deemed as harmful, can have negative, long-term impacts on an individual’s mental and physical health. This article examines the literature on how trauma experienced at the individual-level is influenced by trauma experienced at the community-level and summarizes how each is typically defined and addressed. While much of the focus has been on addressing trauma at the individual level, trauma at the community level directly impacts individual experiences. The Social Ecological Model indicates individual trauma cannot truly be addressed without also addressing community-level factors, including housing, education, and employment opportunities.
