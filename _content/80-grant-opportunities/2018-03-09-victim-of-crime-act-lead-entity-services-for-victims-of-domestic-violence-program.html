summary: |
  <p>ICJIA is the state agency charged with the administration of the Illinois’ Victims of Crime Act Victim (VOCA) Assistance Formula Grant Program. This program is supported by fines and penalties levied against criminals convicted of federal crimes and allocated to states by formula by the Office for Victims of Crime of the U.S. Department of Justice. In federal fiscal year 2016, Illinois received a VOCA award of $87 million.
  </p>
  <p>VOCA grants must support the provision of direct services to victims of violent crime. States are required to allocate a minimum of 10 percent of funds received for services to each of the following: victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, child abuse, and underserved victims of violent crime. VOCA funds may not be used to supplant or replace state and local funds that would otherwise be available for crime victim services and must be used to develop new projects or expand existing projects.

  </p>
  <p>Last year, ICJIA completed a statewide assessment of victim services in Illinois. The report was presented to the Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee for consultation and coordination with other state agencies and victim stakeholder groups. The final report’s recommendations were approved by the ICJIA Board in January 2017. These recommendations outline a comprehensive plan to address victims’ needs in Illinois and are reflected in this funding opportunity Please see the following link to access the report and recommendations: <a data-v-09776980="" href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/ad-hoc-victim-services-committee-research-report">http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/ad-hoc-victim-services-committee-research-report</a>.

</p>
<p>The Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee made a priority of strengthening and expansion of core services for victims of crime. To fulfill this priority, ICJIA made available $17.3 million in VOCA grant funding for core services and related support costs for victims of domestic violence. These funds are available to the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
