summary: 'The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) is accepting applications for fiscal year (FY) 2016 Grants to Expand Care Coordination Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE) through the Use of Technology Assisted Care (TAC) in Targeted Areas of Need (Short Title: TCE-TAC). The purpose of the program is to enhance and/or expand the capacity of substance use disorder treatment providers to serve youth and adults with substance use disorders or co-occurring substance use and mental disorders who have been underserved and/or have special needs (e.g., elderly, ethnic and racial minorities, criminal justice involved individuals, etc.). This is referred to as the “population of focus.”  For the purposes of this FOA, underserved is defined as a individuals that lack access to treatment due to the rural location, transportation challenges in the community, an inadequate number of behavioral health providers including shortages of primary medical care and substance use disorder treatment and mental disorder treatment providers, and/or financial constraints that impact the ability of these clients to access needed behavioral health treatment services.  The use of technology, including web-based services, smart phones, and behavioral health electronic applications (e-apps) will expand and/or enhance the ability of providers to effectively communicate with persons in treatment and to track and manage their health to ensure treatment and services are available where and when needed.  The technology may also be used by grantees to support recovery and resiliency efforts and promote wellness.'
