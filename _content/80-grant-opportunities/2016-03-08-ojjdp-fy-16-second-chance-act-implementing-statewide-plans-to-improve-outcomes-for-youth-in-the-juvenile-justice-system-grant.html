summary: 'Section 101 of the Second Chance Act authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants to states to improve reentry outcomes for incarcerated youth. The Second Chance Act Program helps communities develop and implement comprehensive and collaborative strategies that address the challenges that reentry and recidivism reduction pose. Developing a comprehensive approach for reducing recidivism is challenging for even the most sophisticated juvenile justice agencies, requiring access to data, changes to service delivery, and coordination from multiple systems. This program will provide grants to support the implementation of an existing statewide plan to better align juvenile justice policy, practice, and resource allocation with what research shows works to reduce recidivism and improve outcomes for youth in contact with the juvenile justice system.
