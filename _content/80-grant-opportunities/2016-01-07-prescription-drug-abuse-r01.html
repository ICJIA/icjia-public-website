summary: 'The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) encourages applicants to develop innovative research applications on prescription drug abuse, including research to examine the factors contributing to prescription drug abuse; to characterize the adverse medical, mental health and social consequences associated with prescription drug abuse; and to develop effective prevention and service delivery approaches and behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Applications to address these issues are encouraged across a broad range of methodological approaches including basic science, clinical, epidemiological, and health services research to define the extent of the problem of prescription drug abuse, to characterize this problem in terms of classes of drugs abused and combinations of drug types, etiology of abuse, and populations most affected (including analyses by age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and psychiatric symptomatology). Studies on individual- and patient-level factors, prescriber factors, and/or health system factors are encouraged, as are studies on all classes of prescription drugs with high abuse liability, including analgesics, stimulants, sedative/hypnotics and anxiolytics. Researchers are further encouraged to study the relationship between the prescription medication, the indication for which the medication was prescribed (e.g., pain, sleep disorder, anxiety disorder, obesity), and the environmental and individual factors contributing to abuse.
