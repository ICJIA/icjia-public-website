summary: 'With this solicitation, NIJ seeks proposals for funding to conduct research and technology development leading to the introduction into practice of new and innovative tools to: -Process large-scale computer networks for digital evidence in a forensically sound manner that preserves the probative value of the evidence that the computer network may contain; or - Process mobile devices voluntarily surrendered to law enforcement by witnesses or victims of an alleged crime, which will discriminate between data that is germane to that crime and that which is not, and which will only collect data that is germane; or -Automatically detect children in pornographic videos of varying quality. Individual applicants may propose to address one or more of these topics, but most do so in separate, discrete applications. Single applications proposing to address more than one topic will not be accepted.'
