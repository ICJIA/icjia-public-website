summary: 'This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is issued by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH). The FOA is intended to support pilot, feasibility or exploratory research for up to 2 years in 4 priority areas, including: 1) responses to unexpected and time-sensitive medical system issues (e.g. opportunities to understand addiction services in the evolving health care system); 2) responses to emerging drug abuse-related HIV trends and topics (e.g. rapidly evolving drug abuse-related epidemics, time-sensitive policy or environmental changes); 3) responses to unexpected and time-sensitive criminal justice opportunities (e.g. new system and/or structural level changes) that relate to drug abuse and access and provision of health care service; and 4) responses to unexpected and time-sensitive prescription drug abuse opportunities (e.g., new state or local efforts). It should be clear that the knowledge gained from the proposed study is time-sensitive and that an expedited rapid review and funding are required in order for the scientific question to be answered.'
