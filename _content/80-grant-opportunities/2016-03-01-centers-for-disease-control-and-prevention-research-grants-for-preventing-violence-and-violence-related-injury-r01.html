summary: "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) is soliciting investigator-initiated research that will help expand and advance our understanding of how best to disseminate, implement, and translate evidence-based primary prevention strategies, programs, and policies designed to reduce child abuse and neglect. NCIPC is also soliciting investigator-initiated research to expand our knowledge about what works to prevent violence by rigorously evaluating primary prevention strategies, programs, and policies, to address specific gaps in the prevention of injury caused by child abuse and neglect, teen dating violence, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence. This initiative is intended to support primary prevention strategies, programs or policies that target universal or selected high-risk populations (i.e., populations that have one or more risk factors that place them at heightened risk for initial perpetration of violence). Funds are available for research in the areas of child abuse and neglect, teen dating violence, intimate partner violence, and sexual violence as detailed elsewhere in this document."
