<p>Last year, ICJIA completed a statewide assessment of victim services in Illinois. The report was presented to the Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee for consultation and coordination with other state agencies and victim stakeholder groups. The final report’s recommendations were approved by the ICJIA Board in January 2017. These recommendations outline a comprehensive plan to address victims’ needs in Illinois and are reflected in this funding opportunity Please see the following link to access the report and recommendations: <a data-v-21e82d3c="" href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/ad-hoc-victim-services-committee-research-report">http://www.icjia.state.il.us/articles/ad-hoc-victim-services-committee-research-report</a>. The Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee made a priority of strengthening and expansion of core services for victims of crime. To fulfill this priority, ICJIA made available $17.3 million in VOCA grant funding for core services and related support costs for victims of domestic violence. These funds will be made available to the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence. To fulfill this priority, ICJIA made available $16.3 million in VOCA grant funding for core services and related support costs for victims of sexual assault.
