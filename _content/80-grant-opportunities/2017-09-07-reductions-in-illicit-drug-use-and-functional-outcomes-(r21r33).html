The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to encourage applications for Phased Innovation (R21/R33) projects to determine whether reductions in illicit drug use are associated with positive changes in health-related and other functional outcomes in individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). Functional outcomes include, for example, reductions in morbidity, mortality, criminal justice involvement, overall healthcare expenditures. This FOA provides support for up to two years (R21 phase) for research planning activities and feasibility studies, followed by possible transition to expanded research support (R33 phase). The transition to the R33 phase will be determined by NIH program evaluation of successful achievement of the milestones set for the R21 phase. The ultimate goal of this FOA is to provide evidence that will enable regulatory authorities to accept reductions in illicit drug use as a valid outcome measure in clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of SUDs.
