summary: 'The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite applications proposing the innovative analysis of existing social science, behavioral, administrative, and neuroimaging data to study the etiology and epidemiology of drug using behaviors (defined as alcohol, tobacco, prescription and other drug) and related disorders, associated HIV risk behaviors, prevention of drug use and HIV, and health service utilization. This FOA is a reissue of PAR10-018, broadened to include other existing data modalities, such as neuroimaging data residing either at the collecting institution(s) or at a third-party image repository. Under this FOA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences (OBSSR) encourage the analyses of public use and other extant community-based or clinical datasets to their full potential in order to increase our knowledge of etiology, trajectories of drug using behaviors and their consequences, risk and resilience in the development of psychopathology, strategies to guide the development, testing, implementation, and delivery of high quality, effective and efficient services for the prevention and treatment of drug abuse and HIV.
