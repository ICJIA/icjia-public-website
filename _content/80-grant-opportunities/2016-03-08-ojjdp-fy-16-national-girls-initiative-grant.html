The successful applicant will: • Develop and widely disseminate resources, including information on how to assess state and local justice system decisions and processes and their impact on girls and young women; promising and evidence-based, gender-responsive program models that are culturally competent, trauma-informed, and developmentally appropriate; sample state and local policies; issue papers; talking points; model standards; and assessment tools. • Host roundtables and other regular gatherings to bring together state and tribal juvenile justice stakeholders, state advisory group representatives, practitioners, advocates, researchers, and diverse experts from around the country to promote greater understanding of girls and young women in the juvenile justice system, foster collaboration across the nation, address challenges, and identify priorities and gaps (including those in data collection). • Provide training and technical assistance to support state, tribal, and local girls’ coalitions, alliances, and collaborative efforts to advance the needs of girls. • Assist state juvenile justice specialists and state advisory groups to develop state plans with effective gender-responsive services and interventions for high-risk or system-involved girls, including those with a history of trauma caused by physical and sexual abuse, commercial sexual exploitation, and domestic minor sex trafficking. • Collaborate with other organizations, including private foundations, to support innovation and efforts involving girls’ programs (e.g., summits, decisionmaking processes, strategies, evidence-based treatment) that will extend the reach of OJJDP into the field and limit duplication of efforts.
