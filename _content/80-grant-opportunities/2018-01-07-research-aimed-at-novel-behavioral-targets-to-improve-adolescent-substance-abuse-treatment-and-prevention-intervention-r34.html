summary: This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is part of a trans-NIH initiative known as Collaborative Research on Addiction at NIH (CRAN). Areas supported by this FOA include research to inform the generation and refinement of novel targets for substance abuse treatment and prevention interventions, modules or adjuncts to existing treatments and prevention interventions that seek to target and modulate behavioral or neurobehavioral processes (e.g., impulsivity, risk-taking propensity, sensation and novelty seeking, distress tolerance, delay discounting, self-regulation, stress reactivity) in adolescents. Additionally, this FOA will encourage studies to include theoretical links that explore the relationship(s) between neural circuitry and treatment and prevention effects, and in particular, how behavioral targets might be affected by treatment and prevention interventions, and how that might be used to improve targeted treatment and prevention development, that translate to reduced morbidity and mortality.
