summary: The purpose of this program is to provide funding to states/territories/tribes (hereafter known as states) to improve treatment for adolescents and/or transitional aged youth with substance use disorders (SUD) and/or co-occurring substance use and mental disorders (hereafter known as “the population of focus”) by assuring youth state-wide access to evidence-based assessments, treatment models, and recovery services supported by the strengthening of the existing infrastructure system. Based on need, applicants may choose to provide services to adolescents (ages 12-18) and their families/primary caregivers, transitional aged youth (ages 16-25) and their families/primary caregivers, or both these populations and their families/primary caregivers. Applicants that select transitional aged youth may chose a subset of this population of focus (e.g., ages 16-18, ages 18-21, ages 21-25).
