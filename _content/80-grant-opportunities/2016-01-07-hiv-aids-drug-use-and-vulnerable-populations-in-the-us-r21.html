summary: 'Despite progress in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention and reductions in HIV/morbidity and mortality, HIV/AIDS health disparities remain a challenge that must be addressed. This FOA encourages research to identify the role(s) that drug abuse plays in fueling the epidemic in vulnerable groups (racial/ethnic minorities, men who have sex with men (MSM), youth) in the United States and to develop effective interventions to prevent new infections and to improve the health and well-being of those living with HIV/AIDS. This FOA will support studies in vulnerable populations to: 1) understand the contribution of drug abuse (both injection and non-injection) to the acquisition and/or transmission of HIV; 2) study disease progression and disease outcomes; 3) develop and/or improve prevention and treatment interventions, particularly comprehensive, integrated interventions; 4) improve the availability, delivery and quality of evidence-based prevention and treatment services across a variety of settings; and 5) address organizational, structural, and/or community level factors including social, drug-using, and sexual networks associated with health disparities.
