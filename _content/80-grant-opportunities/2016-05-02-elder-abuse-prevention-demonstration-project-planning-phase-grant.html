summary: 'NIJ, in collaboration with other Federal agencies, is interested in funding a cooperative agreement to conduct a rigorous, multi-year demonstration project to prevent abuse, neglect, and/or financial exploitation among community-residing elderly individuals identified to be at risk. Ultimately, the demonstration project will include development and implementation of the intervention, and, pending funding, a rigorous scientific evaluation of its effectiveness. Successful proposals will develop an intervention that: 1) specifies a theory of change; 2) builds upon evidence-based violence prevention interventions in related areas; 3) identifies a rationale and strategy for selecting participants; and 4) is designed to be replicated, scaled up, and independently evaluated if the demonstration project indicates effectiveness in preventing elder abuse. Applicants may develop and test interventions to prevent either a single form or multiple forms of elder mistreatment. Initial funding under this solicitation will cover an 18-month planning phase. Upon successful completion of the planning phase, additional funding may become available to support the implementation of an 18-month pilot study.'
