summary: On any given day, approximately 60,000 youth are confined in juvenile detention and correctional facilities and hundreds of thousands more are on probation. This system contact can have a significant impact on adolescents lives and their prospects for long-term success in adulthood in obtaining academic degrees, finding work, and securing housing. Collateral consequences (including the lack of records expungement) for juveniles who have come into contact with the juvenile justice system can hinder the ability of young people to integrate into their communities and become successful, thriving adults and increase their chances of recidivism. Barriers to housing, education, employment, health care, and insurance as well as serious immigration consequences and financial repercussions are chief among the tangible consequences. Social, emotional and psychological consequences such as trauma, and a sense of shame and humiliation, are also of great concern. Having a juvenile conviction on your record keeps individuals from fully realizing their potential.
