summary: 'The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) is accepting applications for fiscal year (FY) 2016 Cooperative Agreement for the Provider’s Clinical Support System - Medication Assisted Treatment (Short Title: PCSS-MAT) grant. The purpose of this program is to expand on the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000 and continue SAMHSA’s currently funded PCSS-MAT initiative. Although the current initiative has provided multiple trainings and mentoring support, there still remains a significant need to increase the number of healthcare providers to address the nation’s lack of adequate care. The PCSS-MAT program will continue to provide up-to-date and evidence-based information to support the training of health professionals and to address the complex issues of addiction.'
