<p><strong><em>Statewide Safe from the Start Program Serves Children Ages 0 to 5</em></strong>
</p>
<p>CHICAGO-November 1, 2017.    Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) Executive Director    John Maki today announced the agency has awarded more than $1 million in    grants to programs across Illinois serving young children who have been    exposed to violence
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/grant-programs/safe-from-the-start" target="_blank">Safe    from the Start</a> supports development, implementation, and evaluation of    collaborative community-based models to identify, assess, and provide counseling and family support services to children ages 0 to 5 who have been    exposed to violence in their home and/or community. Without intervention,    young children exposed to violence are at risk for cognitive delays and    emotional and social difficulties that can lead to additional victimization    and later juvenile justice involvement.
</p>
<p>"Safe from the Start is a    unique, research-driven program that reaches urban, suburban, and rural    Illinois children and families," said Executive Director Maki. "We    will continue to support programs that leverage multi-jurisdictional and    collaborative efforts to best serve at-risk populations."
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.icjia.state.il.us/assets/news/Safe_From_the_Start_Year13_Report_070615.pdf" target="_blank">A 14-year study of the early intervention program showed a significant impact.</a> Pre- and post-intervention assessments showed children's trauma symptoms were alleviated with services. In one assessment, 43 percent of SFS child clients scored in the borderline or clinical range of problem behaviors prior to receiving services. That figure dropped to 29 percent post-intervention.
</p>
<p>The study also showed the program was helpful to parents and other caregivers. Following services, the    percentage of caregivers scoring at or above the borderline clinical range on the Parental Stress Inventory assessment dropped from 42 percent to 33 percent.
