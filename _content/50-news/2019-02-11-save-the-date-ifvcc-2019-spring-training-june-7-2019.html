<p>Dan Rincon is a 28-year veteran of the Scottsdale Police Department (Arizona) and earned a Master’s in Criminal Justice Degree from Arizona State University. Previous to his career in law enforcement, Dan served in the United States Navy for four years (1985-1989) and the Arizona Department of corrections for two years (1989-1991).</p>
<p>Dan holds the rank of Police Lieutenant and was the Domestic Violence Unit supervisor for over five years. He has served on the East Valley Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board (Phoenix Metropolitan Area), currently serves as a faculty member for the Training Institute on Strangulation Prevention (Alliance for HOPE International – San Diego) and has been a commissioner since 2012 on the  Governor’s Commission to Prevent Violence Against Women for both past Governor Jan Brewer and current Governor Doug Ducey.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Rincon’s investigative experience includes being lead detective and supervising a range of investigations including homicides, robberies, sexual assaults, major assaults, domestic violence cases, child abuse and gang crimes. While under his leadership, detectives from the Domestic Violence Unit increased their physical arrests 230% over a two year period, decreased individual caseloads by 80%, and created a Domestic Violence Repeat-Offender Database that gave first responders the ability to   access an offender’s criminal history and convictions while still at the scene of a reported DV crime. These initiatives contributed to a 7% decrease in domestic violence in the City of Scottsdale in 2008,which was the first annual decrease in domestic violence incidents in over a decade.</p>
<p>As a subject matter expert, Lieutenant Rincon has dedicated himself to educating law enforcement professionals, prosecutors, victim advocates and other stakeholders across the country in the investigation of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, and homicide cases. He also specializes in domestic violence dynamics and fatal and near-fatal strangulation investigations and the use of Body-  Worn Cameras in criminal investigations.</p>
<p>As part of the Scottsdale Police Department’s management team, Lieutenant Rincon has served in their Investigative Service Bureau, Uniformed Service Bureau, Training Unit, and the Office of the Chief of Police - Internal Affairs.</p>
