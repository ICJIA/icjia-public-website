  <p>The Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council (SPAC) released the first cost benefit analysis report on the high cost of recidivism and the supplement that fully explains our methodology.  SPAC adopted this model and requested technical assistance from the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative because the model has been tested and accepted in the legislative and budgeting processes in Washington State for over 15 years, it was free, and it came with a multi-disciplinary technical assistance team.  Using this model allows us to apply the best national research to Illinois-specific crime data.  More importantly, the model is the best tool to determine the efficient use of tax dollars to minimize the risk that crime will occur.
