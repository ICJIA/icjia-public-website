RVDC developed the DPCC program to address mental health needs of detained youth through appropriate community-based treatment services imposed as conditions of probation. The DPCC program is administered through a collaboration of RVDC mental health staff, and Will and Kankakee county juvenile court judges and probation officers. This evaluation was conducted to better understand the DPCC program model and the extent to which it influences linkage to community-based treatment services and enhances juvenile justice outcomes of probation compliance and subsequent reduced detention admissions and arrests. </p>'
