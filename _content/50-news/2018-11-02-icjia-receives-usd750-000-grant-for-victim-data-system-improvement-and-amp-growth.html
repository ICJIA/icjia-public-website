  <p>ICJIA received a $750,000 grant from the U.S. Office for Victims of Crime to improve and expand InfoNet, Illinois' central repository for crime victim services data. <br>
      <br>
    Funding will be used to build more automated data reporting tools and collect meaningful service outcome measures to track progress and identify changing circumstances in a victim's life, including safety and overall well-being.<br>
      <br>
    InfoNet also will receive a new interface that meets data collection and reporting needs of law enforcement and prosecutor-based victim service providers. The interface will allow data collection on victims of gun and gang violence and survivors of homicide, widening InfoNet's application to all forms of victimization.<br>
      <br>
    InfoNet is a web-based data collection and reporting system used by victim service providers in Illinois. The system is nationally recognized for facilitating standardized data collection and state-level reporting.</p>
