  <p>The Illinois' FY18 State budget includes $8,000,000 for Community-Based Violence Intervention and Prevention (CBVIP) grants and administration. ICJIA anticipates that approximately $6,700,000 to $7,200,000 will be available under the CBVPI Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), with individual grants ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000 to support programming for an initial 9-month period. The anticipated grant period is October 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018. The target population is youth and young adults, including, but not limited to, those who are identified as being at heightened risk or those who engage in high risk behavior or violence throughout Illinois.
  </p>
  <p>ICJIA anticipates releasing the CBVIP NOFO between July 19 and July 26, and will be open to public and not-for-profit entities that provide community-based violence prevention and intervention services in the State of Illinois. Note that this NOFO is not open to Cure Violence/CeaseFire (University of Illinois at Chicago) and its sub-grantees for similar activities for the same population in light of a separate state FY18 appropriation for that purpose.
