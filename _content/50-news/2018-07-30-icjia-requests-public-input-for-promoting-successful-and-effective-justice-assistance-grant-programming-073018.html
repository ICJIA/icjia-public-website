<p>The Illinois Criminal Justice  Information Authority (ICJIA), the state administering agency for the federal  Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG), is seeking public  input on its federal fiscal year 2018 JAG application.</p>
<p>JAG allows state and local  governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime  and improve the criminal justice system. JAG  funds have supported government programs to enforce Illinois drug laws,  decrease the likelihood of violent crime, and improve the criminal justice  system and its outcomes. </p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT PURPOSE AREAS AND  PRIORITIES</strong></p>
<p>JAG funds can be used for state  and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment,  supplies, contractual support, and information systems for criminal justice in  any of the following purpose areas:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Prosecution and court programs</li>
