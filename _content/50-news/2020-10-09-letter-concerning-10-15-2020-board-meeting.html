The R3 grant process is unique among the grant programs that we oversee at ICJIA. The R3 statute gives the R3 board the authority to approve the distribution of program resources but reserves the awarding of grants to ICJIA. Fundamentally the way this will work, is that first ICJIA will present funding recommendations to a subcommittee of the R3 board. Second, that subcommittee will make recommendations to the full R3 board for approval; and finally we will present what the R3 board approves to the ICJIA budget committee.
