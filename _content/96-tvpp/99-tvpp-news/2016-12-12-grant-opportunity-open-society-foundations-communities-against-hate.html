<p>This rapid-response initiative of the Open Society Foundations aims to support, protect, and empower those who are targets of hateful acts and rhetoric. The initiative is designed to bolster communities’ ability to resist the spread of hate and strengthen protections for their most vulnerable neighbors.</p>

<p>The ICJIA Targeted Violence Prevention Program encourages Illinois communities (faith and community-based organizations and other eligible applicants) to join us in the work of preventing violence inspired by hate ideologies.  No community is immune from being a victim of ideologically inspired targeted violence, and any individual - a sibling, a friend, a son, or a daughter - can be lured into such hate-inspired violence. </p>
<p>A new grant opportunity from Open Society Foundations is now available to help address hate-inspired violence in our communities and to respond to its aftermath.  Please visit Open Society Foundations for specific details on this grant opportunity. </p>
<p>From the "Communities Against Hate" grant website:</p>
<p>"We expect that this initiative will serve direct resources quickly to organizations that are well positioned to provide support, services, technical assistance, and outreach to individuals and organizations dealing with acts of hate. We intend this program to respond to what communities believe is of greatest value to address the rise in hate incidents and other threats to vulnerable groups and thus intend to remain flexible and support an array of responses. We expect that they will include: direct services including legal, social services, and mental health supports such as those related to posttraumatic stress; protection of vulnerable nonprofit staff and organizational assets (e.g., data and communications security); efforts to work collaboratively across communities; collection of hate-incident data to further effectiveness in response and promote awareness of the issue; litigation; and public education and training programs."</p>
