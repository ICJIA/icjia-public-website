		<h1 class="main-head">Our Approach</h1>
		<div style="font-weight: 200; margin-bottom: 45px; color: #777">Ideologically inspired targeted violence harms all Illinoisans, and the perpetrators of these crimes come from all walks of life, many different backgrounds, and from many different communities.</div>


		<p class="drop">The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s Targeted Violence Prevention Program (TVPP) uses a public health approach to preventing ideologically inspired targeted violence.  TVPP works with interested communities in building and sustaining community-level programs that can prevent individuals from being recruited to commit ideologically inspired targeted violence, and to help off-ramp individuals who have begun down the path ideologically inspired targeted violence but have not yet committed a crime.</p>

<h2 class="page-sub">The Problem We Face Today</h2>

<p>Ideologically inspired targeted violence is a low frequency/high impact crime.  Whether it takes the form of domestic terrorism or violent hate crimes, it is a scourge on our society, and it strains the healthy social cohesion essential to our diverse communities.</p>

<p>Illinois is home to 23 active hate groups, and in 2014 there have were 131 cases of hate crimes in the state.  Of those, 101 were cases of intimidation, assault and aggravated assault.</p>

	<span style="font-family: 'Alfa Slab One', cursive; font-size: 26px; color: #666">Prevention of ideologically inspired targeted violence requires a whole-of-community mindset using pro-active efforts.</span></div>
<p>According to FBI Director James Comey there are approximately 900 investigations across the United States of individuals who may be involved in either domestic terrorism or material support of a terrorist organization.  Since 9/11 there have been at least numerous cases of attempted domestic terrorism or material support of terrorism prosecuted by state and federal prosecutors in Illinois.</p>

<p>The ideologies that inspire these crimes are promoted by a range of organizations and movements including white supremacist and anti-government groups as well as Islamic State, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and other affiliated entities.  Ideologically inspired targeted violence harms all Illinoisans, and the perpetrators of these crimes come from all walks of life, many different backgrounds, and from many different communities.</p>

<p>Consequently, prevention of ideologically inspired targeted violence requires a whole-of-community mindset using pro-active efforts.</p>


<h2 class="page-sub">Prevention Through Partnerships</h2>

<p>The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is responsible for promoting policies and programs across the state to prevent violence.  Leveraging the knowledge and expertise of the ICJIA staff in working with community-based and faith-based partners in communities throughout Illinois as well as its relationships within academia, other state agencies, the federal government, local units of government, law enforcement, and the private sector, TVPP is working to get ahead of ideologically inspired targeted violence before it grows as it has in other U.S. jurisdictions as well as in other nations around the world.</p>

<p>The Targeted Violence Prevention Program promotes a public health approach to preventing ideologically inspired targeted violence.  Our approach relies on promoting prevention at the community-level through community-based and faith-based organizations. Working with community-based and faith-based organizations that wish to prevent ideologically inspired targeted violence in their communities, TVPP helps to build and sustain prevention programs.</p>

<h2 class="page-sub">The Public Health Model</h2>

<p>The public health approach can be divided into three components: (1) primary prevention, (2) secondary prevention, and (3) tertiary prevention.  Prevention includes a range of activities often referred to as “interventions”.  Interventions are intended to reduce risks or threats to one’s health.  TVPP focuses on primary and secondary prevention that can be delivered through interventions through community-based and faith-based organization-led programs.</p>

<p>Primary prevention aims to prevent an injury or a disease before it occurs.  This can be accomplished by preventing exposure to hazards that cause the injury of disease sought to be prevented.  In the context of ideologically inspired targeted violence, primary prevention may include interventions such as education about the risks of violence promoting messages found on social media, teaching individuals how to use peaceful strategies to promote social change, and activities that promote a positive, inclusive environment in our schools, houses of worship, workplaces and the community at large.</p>

<p>Secondary prevention seeks to detect and treat an injury as soon as possible to halt its progress and to encourage strategies that prevent it from happening again.  For individuals who are exposed to violence promoting messages and who exhibit behaviors that may suggest engagement in violence, the secondary prevention interventions may include counseling, mentoring, and other services.  These services may be provided by a range of entities such as schools, faith-based and community-based organizations, public health and human service agencies, and services from the private sector.</p>
