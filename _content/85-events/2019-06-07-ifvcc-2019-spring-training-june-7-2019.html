Dan is married and has five children  ranging from the ages of 32 to 14 years old and resides in Phoenix, Arizona.  Previous to his career in law enforcement, Dan served in the United States Navy  for four years (1985-1989) and the Arizona Department of corrections for two  years (1989-1991).</p>
<p>He holds the rank of Police  Lieutenant and was the Domestic Violence Unit supervisor for over five years.  Dan has served on the East Valley Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board  (Phoenix Metropolitan Area), and currently serves as faculty for the Training  Institute on Strangulation Prevention (Nat’l Family Justice Center Alliance –  San Diego), and has been a commissioner since 2012 on the Governor’s Commission  to Prevent Violence Against Women for both past Governor Jan Brewer and current  Governor Doug Ducey.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Rincon’s investigative  experience includes being lead detective and detective sergeant on homicides,  robberies, sexual assaults, major assaults, domestic violence cases, child abuse  and gang related investigations. While under his leadership, the Scottsdale  Police Department’s Domestic Violence Unit detectives increased their arrests  made by 230%, decreased individual caseloads by 80%, and created a Domestic  Violence Repeat-Offender Database that gave first responders the ability to  access an offender’s criminal history and convictions while still at the scene  of a reported DV crime. These initiatives contributed to a 7% decrease in  domestic violence in the City of Scottsdale in 2008, which was the first  decrease in domestic violence cases in over a decade. Since 2009, Lieutenant  Rincon has dedicated himself to educating law enforcement professionals,  prosecutors, victim advocates and others stakeholders in the area of domestic  violence investigations and specifically fatal and near fatal strangulation  investigations throughout Arizona and nationally. As part of their management  team, Lieutenant Rincon has served in their Investigative Service Bureau,  Uniformed Service Bureau, Training Unit, and the Office of the Chief of Police  - Internal Affairs.</p>
