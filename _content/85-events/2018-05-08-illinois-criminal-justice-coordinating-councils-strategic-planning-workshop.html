_template: event
---
<p>Join us for a Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Strategic  Planning Workshop in Bloomington May 8-9. </p>
<p>Hosted by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information  Authority, this workshop will build on the work of the County Criminal Justice  Planning Partnership over the past year. </p>
<p>Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCCs) follow a  structured, data-driven planning process to identify, analyze, solve, and  manage justice system issues. This work leads better understanding of  crime and criminal justice problems, greater cooperation among agencies and  units of local government, clearer objectives and priorities, more effective  resource allocation, and better quality criminal justice programs and  personnel. Taken together, these results can increase public confidence in and  support for criminal justice processes, enhancing system performance and,  ultimately, the integrity of the law.</p>
<p>County representatives from counties that have formed or are  interested in developing CJCCs are invited.</p>
<p>The workshop will include panels, breakout sessions, technical  training, and networking. The event also will highlight the Trends &  Issues reports issued to each CJCC partner site and guide in the  development of strategic plans and special projects.</p>
<p>The workshop will take place the afternoon of Tuesday, May 8, and  all day Wednesday, May 9. Participants also are invited to attend an optional  morning session at the 2018 Adult Redeploy Illinois All Sites Summit May 10 at  the same location.</p>
