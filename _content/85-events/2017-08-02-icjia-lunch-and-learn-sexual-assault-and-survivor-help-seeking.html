<p>University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Sarah Ullman, Ph.D., will present her research on survivor help-seeking behaviors following sexual assault and support providers' experiences providing help. The purpose of the talk is to discuss survivor disclosure of sexual assault and how support providers respond to disclosure, as well as the impact of disclosure on support providers.</p>
<p>Attendees will be encouraged to share their thoughts on how these research findings can inform victim service provision, including the role of support provided by friends, family, and significant others.</p>
