<p>“The Authority's General Counsel is essential to all aspects of Authority operations, from overseeing the administration of more than $100 million in grant funding to protecting the agency’s overall legitimacy,” Executive Director Maki said. “Through her experience, judgment, and commitment to the state’s criminal justice system, I know that Ms. Weis will strengthen the Authority and our ability to realize the agency’s mission of improving public safety through research-driven grantmaking and policy work.”
</p>
<p>Ms. Weis has a strong record of providing criminal pro bono legal services. She worked closely with lawyers at the Children & Family Justice Center of Northwestern University School of Law on post-conviction litigation related to Miller v. Alabama, a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders.
</p>
<p>Ms. Weis holds a Juris Doctor from Duke University School of Law and a Bachelor of Science in Management degree in Finance and Legal Studies in Business from Tulane University.
