<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multidisciplinary response teams collaborate to improve their  initial responses to crime, quality of evidence collection, victim interviews,  and victim referrals. Applications submitted by the awarded counties  demonstrated program commitment from all partnering agencies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This funding initiative is part of a research driven effort  by the Authority to support best practices in criminal justice,” Executive  Director Maki said. “Multijurisdictional response team programs operate with a  victim-centered approach while ensuring an effective coordinated response to  domestic violence and sexual assault.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Authority set asid9e $4 million in federal fiscal year  2015 Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding to expand the number of response  teams serving victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,  and/or stalking across Illinois. A 25 percent local fund contribution was  required and funds must be spent over a 12-month period.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This initiative is part of a three-year effort by the  Authority to expand VAWA-funded multidisciplinary response teams across the  state. Funds also may be used to support strategic planning in counties that  want to explore program implementation while garnering commitment from justice  system stakeholders.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Authority is dedicated to improving the administration  of criminal justice with work in the areas of grants administration, research  and analysis, policy and planning, and information systems and technology.
