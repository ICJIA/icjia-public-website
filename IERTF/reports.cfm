<h4>Inventorying Employment Restrictions Act Reports</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=097-0501&amp;GA=97">Task Force on Inventorying Employment Restrictions Act [20 ILCS 5000]</a> was created to review the statutes, administrative rules, policies, and practices that restrict employment of individuals with a criminal history, and to report to the Governor and the General Assembly those employment restrictions and their impact on employment opportunities. This statute requires all state agencies to submit a report that describes restrictions for employment within the agency, in facilities licensed, regulated, supervised, or funded by the agency, and in occupations that the agency licenses or provides certifications to practice.</p>
