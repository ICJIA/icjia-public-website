							<img src="img/headshots/connolly.png" alt="Pat Connolly"/>
							<p></p>Urbana Police Chief Patrick Connolly began his law enforcement career in 1977 
							when, for six years, he was assigned as a Special Agent with the Air 
							Force Office of Special Investigations.  In 1984 he left active duty military service to develop Champaign County's 
							first Intensive Probation Supervision program.  Four years later, he began his career with the Urbana Police Department, 
							and since that time has touched every division within the department including patrol, criminal investigations, 
							two specialized narcotics units, two first line supervisory positions, two commander level positions, the METRO/SWAT 
							Commander, the Assistant Chief of Police and most recently, Urbana's Chief of Police. </p> 

<p>Chief Connolly graduated from PTI in 1988 and is also a graduate of Eastern Illinois University.  Additional Law Enforcement Academies include, Northwestern's Staff and Command School (160th Session) and the FBI National Academy (230th Session).    In 2003 he retired from the United States Air Force with over twenty-four years of combined service.
</p>

<p>
Pat has lectured at various law enforcement communities throughout the US and abroad 
including the Ukraine as well as to the Chinese Delegation of the 2008 Olympic Committee.  
He is also the primary instructor for the Illinois Law Enforcement Alarm System (ILEAS) Mobile Field Force teams.</p>

						<h6>Robert L. Davis</h6>
						<div class="member-title">Senior Vice President & Managing Director</div>
						<div class="member-agency">Hillard Heintze</div>
						<div class="member-bio">
						<span class="expander">
							<img src="img/headshots/Davis1.png" alt="Robert L. Davis"/>
							<p>
								
								
								
								Robert Davis is a highly regarded and innovative national leader 
							and expert in policing and public safety with a special emphasis
							 on ethics and integrity programs. As Senior Vice President and Managing 
							 Director at Hillard Heintze, Davis is responsible for the firm's West Coast operations and leads the Hillard Heintze Senior Leadership Council (SLC).
</p>

<p>Most recently, as a member of the SLC, he distinguished himself as a critical advisor and senior team member on a high-level 2011 engagement that Hillard Heintze conducted in partnership with DHS's Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute to evaluate the existing integrity and counter-corruption programs within U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
</p>
<p>Innovation has been the cornerstone of his career in policing and public safety.  A 30-year veteran of the San Jose, California Police Department (SJPD), Davis rose from patrol officer to Chief of Police of the tenth-largest city in the nation (2004-2010).  He gained recognition for his progressive use of technology, his sensitivity to the diversity of the citizens under his protection and his internationally lauded model of gang prevention, intervention and suppression.
</p>
<p>Davis oversaw what has historically been the lowest-staffed police department of any major city in the country -- 
with only 1.2 sworn officers per 1,000 residents (the national average is approximately 2.6 
officers per 1,000 residents).  According to the FBI -- and, in many respects, a clear measure 
of Davis' leadership in recent years -- San Jose is routinely ranked one of the safest "big cities" in America.  This distinction is even more remarkable given that the Department received this accolade amid seven straight years of budget cuts while fighting crime in a city that adds 15,000 to 20,000 new residents every year.  As a Captain, Davis oversaw the nation's first voluntary study of racial profiling conducted by a local police agency.
</p>
<p>Davis has also earned international recognition as an expert in
 addressing gangs and gang violence, having served as a consultant for 
 the U.S. State Department on five separate occasions.  He traveled to El Salvador, 
 Honduras, Venezuela, Guatemala and Nicaragua to provide training to federal police 
 agencies, politicians, government administrators, education leaders, heads of social
  service organizations and citizens regarding the design, implementation and evaluation of anti-gang programs.
 Davis has served in national and international leadership positions, in part as 
 President of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. In this capacity, Davis took a 
 leadership role in advocating on Capitol Hill for the reallocation of the 700 MHz
, broadband radio spectrum (the "D Block") to public safety -- paving the way for an interoperable, 
nationwide broadband network for all public safety partners at the local, state and federal level that will significantly impact their ability to share both voice and strategic data information.
</p>
<p>Davis holds a B.A. with Honors in English from San Jose State University and graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Master of Public Administration degree from Golden Gate University.  He holds a Master Instructor's Certificate from the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training and is a graduate of the FBI's national Executive Institute and the FBI's National Academy.

							<p>Hillard earned the CPD's highest rank and distinction the old-fashioned way:

							  mayoral Executive Security Detail and later to Intelligence Division Sergeant, District Commander, Chief of Detectives,
							   Coordinator of the Chicago Terrorist Task Force and Lieutenant in Gang Crimes and Narcotics Sections. 
							    In fact, the programs and initiatives of his administration transformed the CPD into a best practice-setting, 
								21st century law enforcement agency -- with changes that spanned critical law enforcement domains such as technology, 
								information exchange, community policing and police accountability.  
								His career reflects bravery, dedication to duty, extraordinary sensitivity to others and an outstanding ability
								 to develop successful programs to safeguard others.</p>

<p>Hillard enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1963, served 13 months in Vietnam and received four 
medals and a Presidential Unit Citation.  He entered the Chicago Police Training Academy in 1968.
